<p>The distance from Melrose to the castle
of Aikwood being only about nine English
miles, our party came in view of it before
sun-set. It was one of those dead calm
winter evenings, not uncommon at that
season, when the slightest noise is heard at
a distance, and the echoes are all abroad.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the huge dark-looking
pile, silence prevailed among them
more and more. All was so still that even
that beautiful valley seemed a waste. There
was no hind whistling at the plough; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
cattle nor sheep grazing on the holms of
Aikwood; no bustle of servants, kinsmen,
or their grooms, as at the castles of other
knights. It seemed as if the breath of the
enchanter, or his eye, had been infectious,
and had withered all within its influence,
whether of vegetable, animal, or human
life. The castle itself scarcely seemed to
be the abode of man; the massy gates were
all locked; no porter was in attendance;
and there was only one small piping smoke
issuing from one of the turrets.</p>

<p>"Gude faith! callans," said Charlie,
"that's a douth and an awsome looking
bigging. I wish we were fairly in, and
safely out again."</p>

<p>"Is that now to be my residence, Yardbire?"
said the beautiful Delany. "Will
you go away, and leave Elias and me in that
frightsome and desolate looking mansion?"</p>

<p>"If the great Master gie us a civil answer,"
said Charlie, not well wotting what
to say,&mdash;"and desire to have you for his
handmaiden, or rather the mistress of his
castle, to overlook the other maids, and
the spinning and weaving concerns like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
then we have orders to leave you. But,
if he should be cross, and crabbit, and
paughty wi' us, ye're in gude hands, and
we'll no quat wi' you sae easily."</p>

<p>"Thou art in good hands indeed," said
the friar: "But, alas! what is man! a
flower of the field that the hand of the
mower cutteth down and leaveth to decay:
A shadow; a sound that passeth away and
is not. But, maiden, thou art in better
hands than ours; in hands that will not
leave the innocent and guiltless to perish.
There is an arm around thee that thou seest
not: there is a guardian with a sword
behind thee and before thee, of whom thou
art not aware. Therefore have thou no
fear, for no evil shall befal thee."</p>

<p>"Methinks I could live any where, and
be void of fear, if but suffered to be in your
presence," said Delany: "There is something
in what you have told me that goes
to my heart, and on it I think I can rely."</p>

<p>"Blessed be thou, my daughter!" said
he; "yea, and blessed shalt thou be in thy
generation"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hear to that!" said the poet aside:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
"Still on one subject! It is all over with
some body!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"But thou art perhaps going into a
place of danger, and evil things may await
thee. Here, take thou this, and keep it
in thy bosom; and, by the blessing of the
Holy Virgin, it shall shield thee from all
malevolent spirits, all enchantments, and
all dangers of the wicked one; the time
may come when thou shalt more thoroughly
understand the great things contained
in this book."</p>

<p>As he said this, he put into her hand a
small gilded copy of the Four Evangelists,
which she kissed and put into her bosom.
All the rest saw this, and took it for a book
of the Black Art.</p>

<p>By this time they were drawing near to
the gate at Aikwood, where all continued
silent and still as formerly. Notwithstanding
of this, Charlie's horse, Corby, began
to cock his ears and snort in a terrible manner.
Stout-hearted as Charlie war, his countenance
began to alter; but he uttered not
a word farther than coaxing Corby to proceed.
The mule leading the way altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
regardless, the horses jogged on after him,
example going farther than precept, whether
with man or beast. All the horses were,
however, become restive, though none of
them was half so fierce as Corby. He continued
to force down his head, as if smelling
the ground; anon capering and snuffing the
air, snorting aloud, and moving with an
elasticity rather like a thing of spirit than
of joints and bones. "Gude faith, Corby,
my man," said Charlie, as he patted his
mane, "a' isna right here! Wend on, ye
camstairy thief: what the deil ails ye?
But, gude sauf us! ane should take care
wha they name here. They say, an speak
o' the deil he'll appear."</p>

<p>The old proverb had scarcely left Charlie's
lips, when, all at once, they beheld three
pages in black livery standing ranged before
the gate, although the moment before
there was no living creature there. They
seemed to have arisen out of the ground, and
as they rose they bowed their heads in a sarcastic
way to the embassy. The appearance
of the pages, and the motion that they
made were both accomplished in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
moment of time, and at the motion every
one of the horses broke away, like so many
scared wildfowl, some one way, and some
another. Charlie tried to restrain Corby with
the whole might of his capacious arm; but
the impatient animal plunged and bounded
into the air with such violence, that his
rider was obliged to give him head, and
away he sprung like a roe over field and
river, straining every nerve to be out of
sight of Aikwood, while Charlie's warrior
cloak, that hung only by the shoulder
clasp, flapped so far behind him that he
appeared like a black cloud skimming the
valley. Though none of the other horses
made equal speed with Corby, every one
ran as fast as it could, and all to the eastward,
though far asunder.</p>

<p>The mule, on the contrary, never moved
nor concerned himself about the matter.
He indeed held forward his long ears, and
took a serious look of the pages, as of some
sort of beings he did not more than generally
understand. Nevertheless he despised
them, and looked about with apparent astonishment
and derision at the madness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and folly of his associates. The friar, finding
himself left with his mule and the
three pages thus unaccountably, began to
address the latter; but they only imitated
his motions, and made wry faces, without
returning him any answer. The mule had
by this time taken another serious look at
them, and disliking them exceedingly, he
sidled towards them with all his mettle,
and tried to hit them with his heels. The
urchins then raised such an eldritch laugh
that they made the arches of the castle to
ring, and, skipping about and about, provoked
the mule to farther violence. He,
on his part, was nothing loth to attack;
he ran open-mouthed at one, kicked at
another, and tried to crush another up against
the gate, all to the great annoyance
of the friar, who, with the utmost difficulty
kept his seat for a good while, in spite
of the mad evolutions of his provoked and
provoking beast. But the game once begun
was not suffered to subside. The giggling
elves, with the swiftness of lightning,
skipped about, and, in whatever direction
the mule darted, one of them was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pricking him behind. The worthy friar
waxed very wroth, and swore by the life of
Pharaoh that he would execute vengeance
on them. But the noise of mirth and mischief
waxed louder and louder, until the
austere inmates of the castle heard; and
the great Master said to his only attendant,
"Gourlay, what is the meaning of all
this uproar?"</p>

<p>"It is only Prig, Prim, and Pricker,"
said he, "making sport with a mendicant
friar and his ass."</p>

<p>"Are they killing him?" enquired his
Master, with the greatest composure, and
without lifting his eyes from a large book
that lay before him.</p>

<p>"I wot not, sire," said Gourlay, with
the same indifference.</p>

<p>"Ay, it is no matter," returned the Master;
"It will keep them in employment a
little while."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Gourlay,&mdash;and retired
back to the casement with sullen step.</p>

<p>By this time the mule had become so
outrageous, that he wheeled, kicked, and
plunged, like one of the furies; and, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
last, in spite of all the friar could do, laid
him fairly on his back, amid the frantic
shrieks and gibberish of his tormentors.
Gourlay beheld the incident from the crevice
of the turret, and, not daring to discompose
the great Master, he walked down
to the gate to witness the sport at a shorter
distance; though with a callous indifference
about the matter, and without the
least hope to enjoy it.</p>

<p>When he came nigh to the scene of action,
he looked as if he expected the friar
to have been dead, and was rather astonished
when he saw him raise his head, and
utter a solemn anathema against the pages,
who fled back as if awed and overcome.
The seneschal not comprehending this,
turned his pale glazed cheek toward the
friar, elevated his brow as if looking at the
verge of the high hill beyond the river, and
stood motionless, stealing a side glance,
now and then, of the stranger.</p>

<p>The latter raised up his gruff face, inflamed
with passion, and, seeing the tall
ungainly figure of Gourlay standing like a
statue, with a red turban on his head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a grey frock or mantle, that in ample folds
covered him from the neck to the sandals,
took him at once for the mighty enchanter,
and addressed him with as little respect as
might be.</p>

<p>"If thou art the lord of this mansion,
draw near unto me, that I may tell thee of
the deeds of thy servants, which eat thy
bread, and stand at thy gate. Lo, have
they not lifted up the hand against my
life, who am a stranger, and a servant
of him against whom thou hast rebelled
and lifted up the heel? Go to; thou
art a churl, and a derision, and a bye-word
among thy kindred and people,
and not worthy to be called by their name.
I came unto thy gate in peace, on a message
of peace, and the words of peace were
in my mouth; and why hast thou suffered
these children of the wicked one to
maltreat and abuse me? Why dost thou
not open thy mouth?"</p>

<p>The pages chattered with a malicious
laugh at a distance, and the seneschal came
stalking near, in a sort of confused astonishment,
to take a nearer view of this talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ing
phenomenon. He came and looked
over him without altering a muscle of his
face; and the friar, irritated by pain and
the contempt shewn toward his sufferings,
went on. At any other time he would
haply have been chilled by the pale frigid
countenance, shagged beard, and glazed
unearthly eye that were now bent over
him; but in the present state of his feelings
he disregarded them; and, though convinced
that he spoke to the mighty enchanter
himself, continued his harangue:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come thou near unto me that I may
curse thee. Thou child of all unrighteousness,
art thou not already cursed among
the children of men? Where are the wealth
and the cheerfulness, where are the welcome,
and the faces of joy and mirth, that
are to be met with at the houses of thy
kinsmen whose bread I eat? Where the
full basket and the welcome store? the
wine that giveth its colour in the glass?
the sounds of mirth and gladness? the
sounds of the song, the viol, and the harp?
And where is thy tongue, that thou canst
not speak?" cried the friar, elevating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
voice to its highest and most impatient
tones.</p>

<p>"Humph," said Gourlay.</p>

<p>"Humph!" returned the friar; "What
dost thou mean by humph? Tell me, in
one word, Art thou the lord of this castle?"</p>

<p>"No; but his seneschal," said Gourlay;
"What hast thou to say?"</p>

<p>"Then lead me to thy master, that I
may see him face to face, and tell him the
words of him that sent me. I will not be afraid
of these dogs of thine and thy master's.
What is become of thy tongue that
thou dost not speak? Tell me, I say, can
I see thy master?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Gourlay; and, seizing
the friar by the shoulder with a rude but
powerful grasp, he dragged him in at the
gate.</p>

<p>"With-hold thine hand, and thy unmannerly
grasp," said the friar,&mdash;"else I
will smite thee with the sword."</p>

<p>The seneschal regarded this threat only
with a grim unmeaning smile; and as he
held the friar by the right arm so firmly
that he even lost the power of it, it was
impossible for him to draw his sword.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay but hearken unto me," continued
he; "surely it is better for thee to live
than to die. Therefore bring in my beast
that he may have provender; and let me
also bring my goods and my changes of
raiment along with me in peace, else how
shall I set up my face before thy master?"</p>

<p>The seneschal then paused, and motioned
with his hand to the pages to bring the
panniers; they ran to obey, but as soon as
any of them touched the huge wallet, he
hastened back and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"Vermin! cannot you bring the furniture?"
cried Gourlay.</p>

<p>They shook their heads, and stood at a
distance.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said he, "I do not comprehend
this," and leading the friar back,
still holding him fast by the arm, he suffered
him to lift the panniers himself, which
he did with good will, and then allowed
himself to be led away by the uncourteous
seneschal, who said to the pages as he departed,
"See to the vile animal!"</p>

<p>Without more ado he led the friar in,
and pushing him rudely into a small vault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>ed
apartment, he locked first a ponderous
iron door, and then a massy wooden one,
full of nails, upon him; and, without regarding
his complaints or anathemas, or
deigning a word in reply to his queries, he
left him to his own bitter reflections.</p>

<p>The apartment at first appeared to be
dark, but on looking about he found that
there were two grated loop-holes in it, and
by the light from these he soon perceived
that there was nothing in the place save
the skeleton of a man of uncommon stature
and dimensions. The bones were lying
flat on the floor, every one in its place
exactly as the man had died, and the flesh
wasted away from them. No disarrangement
had taken place, nor was the smallest
joint wanting. This was a petrifying sight
to the poor friar, who, crossing himself,
and turning from the horrible spectacle,
set his nose through the grating and looked
out on the fields.</p>

<p>The first thing he beheld confounded
him more than all he had ever seen in his
life. The three devilish pages were tampering
with his mule to bring him within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the outer gate; but he, in his usual manner,
proved as refractory as ever, and laid
about him with all his might. On this,
the boys in one moment whipped him up
in their arms, and ere the friar could draw
his breath, far less utter a Pater-Noster,
they set him down in the middle of the
court, straight before the friar's grating,
and tied him to the shaft of a well with
a strong rope. The friar said a Benedicite;
and, ere he had done, the devilish
and provoking imps began to torment the
poor mule beyond all sufferance, whipping
him round and round the post, and making
him fling and jump till the blood and
sweat were pouring together from his
branded sides, and he was no more able to
resent the injuries committed on him. The
friar fumed, and threatened, and cursed them
in the name of the blessed saints; but they
only laughed him to scorn: And when the
mule could no longer resent the lash, they
brought red-hot spindles and pushed them
between his hind-legs, which made him
fling and rear till he fell down at the post,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and lay groaning, unable any more to
move.</p>

<p>The thing that provoked the friar worst
of all was the sight of the tall seneschal
standing looking on, and seeming, by his
motions, to be directing the game. Never
was such a flood of eastern eloquence
heard at Aikwood, as was poured from the
small crevice in the bottom of the eastern
turret that evening. No one, however, regarded
it, or, if they did, it was only to
mock or mimic the sublime deprecator.</p>

<p>To all that he said, the seneschal grinned
a smile of grim disdain, and motioned
to the pages to redouble their sport,
which they did, till, as said, the poor
animal could furnish them with no more.</p>

<p>The friar now beheld a joyful sight
through the twilight, the rest of his companions
coming on foot towards the gate.
They had gathered together at the mill,
about a mile to the eastward of the castle,
and made another attempt to approach it
on horseback; but their efforts were vain;
not a steed would come one step farther
than just in view of it; so they agreed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
put their horses up at the mill, leaving
them in charge of the miller and his two
sons, and to proceed on foot to the castle,
to join their mysterious associate the friar,
whose magical might some of them began
to dread, and others to trust.</p>

<p>Gourlay beheld them approaching as
well as did the friar, and again waited on
the great Master with awe and trembling.</p>

<p>"I pray thee, mighty Master, to forgive
me," said he, "but too true is it that the
wretched pedagogue has said,&mdash;for here
come a body of the warden's friends, with
swords in their hands, and one beautiful
human thing in their company."</p>

<p>"And what then?" said Michael, in a
stern, hollow voice.</p>

<p>The seneschal trembled. "I&mdash;I&mdash;only
want to know how they are to be received," said he.</p>

<p>"Received?" cried the Master, raising
his voice to a pitch that made the old
wretch shrink as it were within himself.
"Received? As spies should, to be sure.
Begone!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Gourlay ran cowering toward the door.</p>

<p>"Stop.&mdash;Come back here. What forces
are in the castle?"</p>

<p>"What forces? Hem! Great Master,
you only know."</p>

<p>"Any things of flesh, I inquire?"</p>

<p>"No, not one; if you except the old
witch Henbane. Oh! I beg your pardon,
great and honoured master! I meant your
worthy and respectable housekeeper."</p>

<p>Michael gave three gentle tramps with
his heel, and in one moment the three
pages in black livery, Prig, Prim, and
Pricker, were at his knee.</p>

<p>"Work, Master, work. What work
now?" said they all in one breath.</p>

<p>"Give your master there a toasting for
his insolence," said Michael.</p>

<p>The pages giggled for joy; the seneschal
kneeled and roared out for mercy,
and, as a motive for granting it to him,
said the strangers were at the gate. The
pages had already laid their fangs on him;
but the Master, on the arrival of the strangers
being brought to his mind, ordered
the imps to desist. This they did on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
instant; but, without delay, rushed on
Michael himself, as if they would tear him
to pieces. He threatened, cursed, and dared
them to touch him; but they seemed
nothing daunted by all he said, but danced
around him with demoniac gestures, crying
still out with one voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Work, Master, work; work we need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work for the living, or for the dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since we are called, work we will have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the master, or for the slave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work, Master, work. What work now?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Miserable wight that I am!" cried the
mighty Master. "Then, d&mdash;d dwarfs,
since it must be so, bring the slave back,
and let him have three varieties, and no
more."</p>

<p>Gourlay had made his escape with all
expedition, but it was not long ere they
overtook him, and brought him back, leading
him in the most grotesque manner
that can well be conceived. They then
began to twirl him about, first with his
face one way and then another; and, latest
adventures making the strongest im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>pressions
on their wicked imaginations, by
some devilish slight they transformed him
into the shape of a mule, and practised on
him all the wanton cruelties they had so
lately done on the friar's, seeming to enjoy
the sport all the while with redoubled
zest. They next changed him into a dog;
and, tying a cannister, containing some
small stones to his tail, they pursued him
round and round the room, and finally out
into the yard, with long whips, every one
breaking at him, and giving him a lash as
he came by. This caused him always now
and then to exert himself with such speed
that the cannister was sometimes hitting
him on the head with a loud rattling yerk,
sometimes on the back, and all over the
body, while the poor steward was running,
yelping in the uttermost desperation. The
friar beheld part of the sport from his grate,
but little wist that it was the hated seneschal
that was suffering, else he would have
doubtless enjoyed the scene in no ordinary
degree. The rest of the embassy also saw it
from the outer gate, where they now stood
rapping and calling without being regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>ed,
the pages being too intent on their
game to pay the least attention to such as
they.</p>

<p>"Let alane the poor tike, like good
lads," cried muckle Charlie, "and come
and open the yett. What ill has the silly
beast done to you?"</p>

<p>"They bring me in mind o' Jock Harper's
terriers," said Gibbie, "that wad rather
do ill for the sake o' doing it, than do
ought that was good or right for a' the
warld."</p>

<p>"I hate to see a colley-shangie," said the
poet; "there is nothing sublime or romantic
in it."</p>

<p>"They're nae canny couts thae three
chaps," said Charlie; "Corby wadna look
at them, and he kens things gayan weel.
We maun just hae a wee patience till they
be done wi' their chace. It's a queer kind
o' place this."</p>

<p>The poor metamorphosed steward, finding
no rest for the sole of his foot, betook
him again to the staircase, and crept down
at his master's feet, deeming the chastisement
to have been over. But he was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sooner there than the pages were after
him, and by the time they had whirled
him three times about, he started up a
hare, and the three pages, turning themselves
into colley dogs set all upon him.</p>

<p>With the form of every quadruped into
the shape of which he was turned, he seemed
to acquire its nature and antipathies,
and in none was it so striking as in the hare.
When the collies began to snap at him, his
terror is not to be imagined; he darted
round and round the hall like lightning,
breaking out and in to Michael's study, to
the great disarrangement of his conjuring
apparatus, books, and papers; while every
time that a colley sprung with open mouth
at him, he uttered a desperate scream.</p>

<p>This was the only one of their frolics that
appeared to amuse the great Master, his
partiality for the sports of the chase being
proverbial to this day. When he saw the
old seneschal laying back his long ears, and
exerting his powers of speed in such manifest
terror, and the malignant collies whinking
after him, and waylaying him in every
strait, making him often spring aloft, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
could not help laughing outright, and
baiting the dogs on him. The tears stood
in the old hare's eyes when he heard this,
nevertheless his fright made him agile; he
bolted from the halls and alleys of the
castle into the extensive yard; and there
was such a hunt! Michael and the friar
both ran to their respective windows to
see the sport, and our party at the outer
gate shouted and hallooed with great energy.
Many a time did the dogs get a snap
at the steward, and make him scream out,
while all the onlookers laughed aloud. At
length, thinking he would actually be worried,
he cleared the wall, and made a bold
effort to gain the wood. But these were
a trio of dogs from which there was no
possibility of escape. Ran he fast or ran
he slow, there were they after him, snatching
at his hips and panting sides, and yelping
so keenly all the while that the seneschal
had no doubt of being torn in pieces
should they fairly seize him. They turned
him, and made him trace many an acute
angle on the hill, while our party were running
after him, throwing always sticks or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stones at the steward, as he hasted by
them, and baiting the dogs on him. Finding,
as formerly, no other resource, he returned
with main speed to the castle, and
crept down at the Master's feet, who, with
one touch of his divining rod, changed him
into his own native forbidding form.</p>

<p>He started up in great wrath; and, though
panting so that he could scarcely speak,
swore a horrible oath, that he would no
longer be kept in bondage and maltreated
in that manner; and that, since it was impossible
for him to escape in any other
way, he would cut his own throat, and run
his chance of an after life.</p>

<p>"Poor dastardly braggart!" said Michael;
"not for the soul that inhabits that
old malicious frame, dare you do such a
thing. I would seize on it, and make
sport of it for ages. I have you wholly in
my power, and, dead or alive, it is the same
thing to me. Were you to do as you say,
and take away your life by a ghastly
wound, I could even make one of these
fiendish spirits enter into your body, re-animate
it, and cause you to go about with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
your gaping wound, unclosed and unpurified,
as when death entered thereat. Think
of what an existence that would be, and
then go and put your miserable threat into
execution."</p>

<p>"Hah! There it is!" said Gourlay:
"Turn me as I will, I see nothing but
wretchedness. Cursed be the day that I
saw you, and ten times cursed the confession
I made, that has thus subjected me to
your tyranny! However, use me another
day as you have used me on this, and you
do it at your peril, if you were the devil
himself. I have warned you."</p>

<p>Michael only smiled contemptuously at
the threat; and again asked what living
creatures were in the castle, as he wanted
a retinue to receive the message of his kinsmen.</p>

<p>"I have told you already," said Gourlay,
in the same passionate and irritated
mood; "and I again repeat it, that there is
no mortal thing in the castle, but the old
witch, and perhaps two or three hundred
rats."</p>

<p>"Take that in the first place then," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Michael, "for your impertinence,"&mdash;at the
same time laying him flat on the floor by
a tremendous blow, although he only moved
his hand toward the steward; "and in
the next place go call out these three hundred
rats you talk of, marshal them up in
the court, and receive the mighty warden's
people with all manner of pomp and respect,
and use them according to their demerits."</p>

<p>The steward roared out with pain; and
gnashing his teeth with rage, he arose growling,
and was hasting away, when the Master
asked him if he was going to accomplish
what he had bidden him do.</p>

<p>"Without doubt;" said he, "Is it not
very likely that I shall be able?"</p>

<p>"Take that then," said the Master, "and
put it above the lock-hole of the door; it
shall serve you as a summons, and Prig,
Prim, and Pricker shall marshal your array."
With that he gave him a small
piece of parchment written in red characters,
which the steward snatched angrily
out of his hand, and going down the stair
did as the Master had ordered him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The charm was effective, and its effects
momentary. The bustling and the screaming
of rats were heard in every corner of
the castle, and forthwith a whole column
of men marched out into the court in three
files, led by the three pages, and headed by
the incensed seneschal in his grey mantle
and cap.</p>

<p>Our messengers looked mightily astonished
when they beheld such a retinue,
and Charlie observed that "it was a confounded
shame for Mr Michael no to join
the warden, and had sae mony idle men
lying tholing starvation beside him." But
then looking wildly around on both sides
to his friends, he added, "God's grace be
about us! wha kens but a' thae may be
spirits or elves in the shapes o'men? I think
they hae unco queer musty-like looks. An
I had Corby here he wad soon tell me wi'
a vengeance."</p>

<p>Old Gourlay, now at the head of his
corps, demanded what the strangers wanted;
and on being informed who they were,
and that they came on a special commission
to the Master, they were admitted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
walked up a lane between two ranks of
armed men in full caparison.</p>

<p>The Master beheld them from his casement,
and was mightily diverted by the
whimsical appearance of the various individuals
that formed the group, two of whom
he conceived to be the most beautiful creatures
he had ever seen. Whoever reads
this will at once guess who these two lovely
beings were; but if he does, he will at
once guess wrong. It would seem that a
wizard sees every thing in this fair and
beautiful creation through an inverted medium,
and that all the common and fine
feelings of nature are in him changed and
distorted. The beauty of the two young
captives appeared, in Michael's eyes, hateful,
and even affected him with loathing;
but two more lovely and engaging creatures
than Jordan and the Deil's Tam he
had never seen on earth. The hooked nose,
wrinkled face, and mouth from ear to ear
of the laird, he thought exquisite; but
Tam's long coulter nose, turned up in front,
his small grey eyes, and shapeless physiog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>nomy,
were beyond all expression engaging.
So, from the time that the Master got
the first look of them, he determined, contrary
to his usual custom, to see and converse
with his guests.</p>

<p>They were soon conducted to the door
of the vault, in which their friend the friar
was immured; and, as soon as the door
opened, he exclaimed, with a loud voice,
"I charge you, O my brethren, and my
companions, that ye come not into this
place, nor set a foot within its boundaries;
for the place is a place of death, and the
bones of the dead men are in it."</p>

<p>There is no deciding what these words
might have produced, had they been pronounced
in time; but as soon as Charlie
and the laird, who were foremost, heard
the friar's voice, they rushed towards him
without thought or fear of the consequences,
and, ere he had done, the hindmost
were pushed in by the relentless arm of the
seneschal, and the iron door closed behind
them. Perceiving how matters stood, the
friar straight lifted up his hands, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>tinued
to declaim in a still more fervent
stile.</p>

<p>"Hout! Gude Lord, friar man, haud
your tongue," said Charlie interrupting
him: "What signifies making sic a frase
as a' this? or what good will it do? I hae
run mysel into mony a priminary in my life,
but I never fand that mony words did muckle
good. I trowed that ye had mair art
about ye than to be feared for a stane an'
lime wa,' an' twa or three airn staincheons.
Pith can do muckle, but art can do mair."</p>

<p>Charlie meant the black art; but the
friar taking him up in another meaning,
shook him by the hand and blessed him.</p>

<p>It may not have occurred to the reader
and it is not likely it should, that this same
friar was an English monk, the most celebrated
man of that age, then exiled from
his country, and obliged to skulk in disguise,
for fear of being apprehended and
burnt as a wizard and necromancer. He
was the greatest philosopher and chemist
of the age, the real inventor of gun-powder,
and many other wonderful discoveries,
and, withal, a pious and good man,&mdash;al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>though
one whose character was tinctured
with peculiarities so striking, that some
took him for a man crazed in his mind, but
far more for a powerful necromancer. His
name is familiar to every man in the least
acquainted with the literature or the science
of that age; but while he remained in Scotland
being always denominated the gospel
friar, we have judged it best to call him by
that name. If the reader has not discovered
this, it is time he should know it; and
whether the friar was a necromancer or not,
will appear in the sequel.</p>

<p>When the party got leisure to converse
together, their first words were expressive
of the astonishment they laboured under
at sight of the warlike force kept up by
the Master. Charlie only testified his regret
that there was not a right and mutual
understanding between him and the warden;
but the maid Delany was the first
to remark that she did not think they were
right men, because their faces were all alike,
and their eyes were not like the eyes of any
human being she had ever before looked
on. In this every one present acquiesced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and great was their wonder how or whence
that mighty armed force had sprung; but
they agreed that there was no contending
with such numbers, of whatsoever nature
they might be, and that there was nothing
for it but submitting to the Master's will.</p>

<p>The day light was by this time quite extinguished,
but the moon was up; and it
being a hard frost, with a slight covering
of snow, or rime, it was nearly as light as
some winter days. Their damp, mouldy
vault with the grisly skeleton lying at the
one side of it, shewed horridly dismal in
the wan and shadowy light, and threw a
chillness over their hearts. They hoped
and looked long for dinner, and then for
supper, but neither of them came; nor did
they hear or see any living thing all that
night, save the friar's mule, that had again
got to his feet, and stood at the post groaning
and trembling of cold. This was a
grievous sight to the friar, for his heart
was moved for the sufferings of his poor
beast; and in the bitterness of his spirit
he vented some anathemas against the unconscionable
seneschal, saying,&mdash;"Verily if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
ever that son of Belial fall into my hands,
I will be unto him as Adramelech and as
Sharezer, and do unto him as they did to
the father that begat them."</p>

<p>Every time that Charlie looked out at
the mule, he testified a sort of inward satisfaction
that his own trusty steed was
not brought into the same scrape, and sundry
times said, "Gude faith, Corby kend
better sense than coming into sic a place
as this is. He's as weel off down wi' the
auld miller; He'll get some pluffins o' seeds
or dust, poor fallow. An they gie him but
water, I'm no feared for him, for there's
plenty o' meat yonder,&mdash;but he'll never do
if they let him want water."</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning the
seneschal entered with a light, but had the
precaution to lock the wooden door before
he opened the iron one. The prisoners had
sat down on the floor, and were leaning on
one another; and, dismal as their lodging
was, some of them had fallen sound asleep.
Delany was leaning on the friar's breast,
and the poet had laid himself down behind
her, and covered her with his mantle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
rest were huddled together, so that they
appeared to be lying above one another;
but all, or most of them, set up their heads
at the entrance of the steward.</p>

<p>Tam was the first to address him.
"What's come o' our supper, goodman,
that you are coming toom-handed? Do
you no think it is time your guests had
something to eat, or hae ye naething either
to eat or drink in this great gousty castle?
I dinna care what ye may think, or what
you may say; but in my opinion you and
your master baith are naething but twa ill-bred
unmannerly niggards."</p>

<p>The seneschal grinned disdain, and clenched
his teeth in wrath. He was about to
reply, but all their tongues were loosed on
him at once, some complaining of one thing
some of another, and the friar more particularly
of the treatment of his beast. All,
however, ended with a request for meat.</p>

<p>"No," said Gourlay; "we have no meat
for spies and forayers. A halter is the only
guerdon we bestow on such dogs. I
want this fair maiden, and for the rest of
you"&mdash;He finished the sentence with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sneer and a point with his finger to the
bones; and seizing the maid by the shoulder,
he dragged her toward the door.</p>

<p>"Softly sir, and if you please," said the
poet, speaking in pure iambics, and seizing
the bars of the iron door before the steward
and his prize. "We have indeed this
maiden brought, from distant camp and
knight renowned, unto the master of this
house; and to none else we give her up:
No, not to thee, nor arm of flesh."</p>

<p>As the poet said these words, he bristled
up, and faced the steward at the door, to
keep him back; but the carl gave him such
a blow on the temples that he staggered
and fell. The friar then interposed, and
though he was a strong and powerful man,
the irascible steward plied his blows so fast
and so hard about his bare pate, that he was
also overthrown. The maiden screamed; and
the old incendiary was within a hairbreadth
of having her outside of the iron door, when
she would have been wholly out of the
power of her friends and protectors. But
at that critical instant Charlie Scott seized
the steward by the arm, never doubting but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that he would twist him like a willow; but
he was mistaken. The churl seized him
by the throat with his left hand, with such
prodigious force that Charlie deemed him
to have the strength of six common men,
and lending him a blow on the face, he
made his mouth and nose to gush blood.
Charlie returned the salute with interest,
yet the steward stood his ground, and a
most desperate struggle ensued, in which
victory appeared doubtful. Gibby perceiving
his friend and champion's jeopardy,
drew out his sword, and was going deliberately
to stick the old ragamuffin behind,
had not Charlie called out furiously to him
to forbear.</p>

<p>"Keep back your whittle, you cowardly
dog," cried he, "else I'll cut you into a
thousand pieces. I never yet took odds
against a man, nor shall I now, unless I
am fighting wi' the devil. In that case I
may measure my backbreadth on the floor.
But be he the devil, be he dicken, I shall
gie him ae squeeze."</p>

<p>Charlie with that closed with his dangerous
opponent, and gave him such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
squeeze that he made his back and ribs to
crash. The steward twisted his face into
the most hideous contortions, and exerted
his whole force to extricate himself, but
Charlie brought him to the ground, falling
upon him with all his ponderous weight.
It was among the bones of the gigantic
skeleton that the two combatants fell;
and Charlie, deeming that he had given
his foe enough for once, and a little startled
to find himself among the rattling
bones, began to unloose his grasp, and said
in a hurried way, "Billy, I'll learn you
how to strike fo'k on the gab and the brigg
o' the nose sae rashly!" and was getting
up as fast as he could, when the steward
gave him such a blow with the thigh-bone
of the dead man, that he had very nigh
brought him down again. If Charlie's
bonnet had not had a bar or two of steel,
that blow would have shattered his skull.
As it was it stunned him a little, and made
the water start into his eyes; and he had
just recollection and strength sufficient
to secure his adversary's arms, by holding
them down, so that he might not repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the blow. Yet, with all this Charlie's
temper was not to be ruffled. He cared
not how often or how much he fought,
but he never fought in wrath.</p>

<p>"Gude faith, my man," said he, "but
ye're no nice o' your chapping sticks! and
foul fa' me gin ye dinna lay them gayan
freely on. But I dinna blame ye. A
wight man never wants a weapon; only
come that gate again an ye dare."</p>

<p>The steward growled and cursed, trying
all that he could to throw Charlie from
above him, and master him by sheer
strength. He had no idea of being overpowered
by a single arm, nor was he wont
to fear half a dozen, but he had never met
with the like of Charlie Scott before. He
might as well have tried to remove the hill
of Aikwood; so he was obliged to succumb,
which he did with a very bad grace;
nor would he either abate one inch in his
demand of having the damsel unconditionally,
or grant one request that they desired
of him.</p>

<p>"Why, then, there's nae help for it, honest
man," said Charlie; "I hae ye firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and fast, and what ye winna gie us we
maun e'en tak at our ain hand. Honest
friar, come you here, and tak' a' the keys
o' the castle aff this camstary hallanshaker,
and we'll e'en help oursels to sic as we
can get. I sal tak care that he sanna move
a spauld against you, and as for his tongue
we maun just let it wag."</p>

<p>The rage of the seneschal, when he saw
himself robbed of the keys of the castle, is
not to be described: he cursed and raged
in such a manner, that, even after the friar
had both doors fairly open, Charlie durst
not move from off him, or let him go, for
fear of some deadly scaith.</p>

<p>"I dinna ken what I'm to do wi' this
deil's buckie," said he; "he's like the tod's
whelps, that grow aye the langer the
waur."</p>

<p>"I wad gie him a settler," said Tam.</p>

<p>"He brings me in mind o' a barrel o'
beer, fuming and fuffing. He'll no settle
till he be pierced," said Gibbie.</p>

<p>The friar then took up his bulky baggage,
and walked out with that and the
light, meaning to bring his mule's halter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wherewith to bind the seneschal; but
Charlie, making his escape from him, locked
him in,&mdash;and thus were our messengers
left in the full and free possession of the
castle of Aikwood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>When the steward saw that he was fairly
mastered, and that neither strength nor
words could avail him ought, he remained
where he was in sullen silence. He had
got no orders from the Master to bring
him the maid, but it had come into his head
to go and take her to himself, and he had
nearly effected his purpose. What might
have been the consequence of his success,
it is painful even to calculate; but he was
thus prevented, though not without blood
and wounds.</p>

<p>The guests now traversed all the lower
apartments of the castle, there being neither
bolt nor bar to interrupt them; but
for all the retinue that they had seen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their arrival, there was neither the appearance
of man nor beast remaining. The
large hall did not seem to have been occupied
for a long period. The shelves were
empty, and there were neither dishes nor
fragments of meat of any description; and
every thing within as well as without the
castle had the appearance of desolation.</p>

<p>At length they came to a door, from the
bottom of which they perceived some light
issuing, of which they were glad, as they
were afraid the steward's lamp would fail
them and leave them in darkness. Deeming
themselves on ticklish ground, they
consulted in a whisper before venturing in.
Charlie Scott was quite a fearless man among
his fellow creatures, but all kinds of
supernatural agency pressed heavily on his
conscience. Therefore, in the present instance,
he dissuaded his comrades from entering,
with all his eloquence.</p>

<p>"Gude faith, callans, keep back off that
place. It is may-be the warlock's room;
and gin he should be in the mids o' some
o' his cantrips at this eiry time o' the morning,
gude sauf us! it is a question what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
might be the upshot. Na, na, friar; I tell
ye, bide back, it is best to let sleeping dogs
lye, for fear they get up and bite you."</p>

<p>But the friar's creed differed from that
of Charlie, and he went dauntlessly forward,
putting him aside with his hand, and
saying at the same time, that he would
"surely go in unto him as with a front of
brass or of iron;" that sooner or later the
time and the season of their meeting must
come, and why should he be dismayed?</p>

<p>The friar then opened the door with
caution, and entered, followed by all his
associates, Charlie Scott bringing up the
rear, and whispering to those next him in
a tremulous voice,&mdash;"Od that body's mad!
He'll lead us into some ill-faur'd snapper.
Dinna be ower rash, callans. Just look
afore ye."</p>

<p>Instead of the great enchanter, however,
they found only an old woman, so busily
engaged with something on the fire, that
she scarcely deigned to regard them as
they entered. She had a wooden tube,
like the barrel of a gun, with which she
blew up her fire; and she kept blowing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it till the flame came above the lip of her
caldron, and let her see into it; for she had
no lamp, nor any other light save that
which came from the fire.</p>

<p>When she had made it blaze thus high,
she spoke to herself, and without taking
her mouth from the tube; saying some
words to the following purport:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sotter, sotter, my wee pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the spirit gin ye can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the scum turns blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blood bells through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's something aneath that will change the man."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Charlie saw her unchristian-like
face, and heard her mumbling these horrid
words through her long hollow tube, he
turned his back and fled, taking shelter in
a void entrance, to which he was led by
some light that fell into it from the rays
of the moon. Full hardly was he then
bested, for he still deemed that he heard
the witch's rites at a distance; and the faint
ray of the moon through a narrow aperture
made the rest of the space appear so shadowy
and dim, that Charlie saw he was in
a dangerous situation, and actually began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to fancy he beheld a face in the dark staring
at him, and still coming nearer. It was
no time to stand there; so he fled with all
his might. But in his dismay he lost every
kind of aim, or consideration whither he
was going, and at once stumbled on the
undermost step of a stone stair. Thinking
the apparition he had seen was by that
time hard upon him, and no other way
that he knew of open for flight, he rose
and pursued his course straight up stairs,
in a state of perturbation hardly to be accounted
for. The first landing place that
he came to he ran himself against a door,
and not finding farther entrance he faced
about, and, leaning over the balluster, he
set up such a yell as never was before
breathed from lungs. It is true he neither
heard nor saw aught of the apparition; but
Charlie was a sensible man, and he was
certain it might be there for any thing
that he knew; so he set up the same kind
of cry that he was wont to do when he lost
his neighbours in a mist, or in a night foray,
only about ten times or so louder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hilloa! Tam Craik! friar! hilloa! d&mdash;n
ye a'; what for winna ye come wi' a light?"</p>

<p>Charlie was now at such a distance from
his comrades, who were still in the witch's
small apartment, and the echoes of the huge
void castle so confused the sounds, that
they took the cries of their captain for the
rushing of a whirlwind roaring through
the crannies of the castle, and paid no regard
to them. No state could be more deplorable
than that in which muckle Charlie
Scott was now placed. To have returned
down the stair would have been meeting
the devil face to face; or, as Charlie
much better expressed it, "to hae dabbed
nebs wi' the deil."</p>

<p>He had therefore no other resource than
to bellow out for assistance; and seeing
none approach, he said aloud in great agony
of spirit, "Lord, gin I were but on Corby's
back again! ay, though it were in
the wildest glen o' a' the Cheviots, and the
Eskdale souple o'er my shoulder," (that
was the cant name of Charlie's tremendous
sword;) "I might then work my way:
But sic a place as this I saw never! Od,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
an there be lugs within the wa's o' the
house I shall either gar them hear or crack
them. Hilloa!"</p>

<p>Not satisfied with giving yelloch after
yelloch, as he termed his loud cries, he flew
to every door on the landing place, laid on
it with his fists, and kicked it with his foot,
calling at each of them in the same key as
before, "Is there ony body here?" He at
last prevailed: one door was opened, and
he was admitted inside. But, alas for our
gallant yeoman! he only by this transition
got out of one exceedingly bad scrape into
a worse.</p>

<p class="break">These casual separations of <i>dramatis person</i>
are exceedingly unfortunate for the
story-teller who aims at conciseness and
brevity; because it is impracticable to bring
them all on at the same time. A story is
like a waggoner and his horses travelling
out the king's highway, his machine loaden
with various bales of rich merchandise.
He goes smoothly and regularly on, till he
comes to the bottom of a steep ascent,
where he is obliged to leave a great proportion
of his loading, and first carry one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
part of it to the top of the hill, then another,
and then another, which retards him
grievously on his way. So is it with the
writer of a true history such as this; and
the separation of parties is as a hill on his
onward path.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with dramatic representations,
and in these the authors have a
great advantage. Let their characters separate
as they will, or be engaged as they
will, they can at any time, with the greatest
ease, be brought together on the stage.
The one enters from the one side, and the
other from the other, and we do not much
concern ourselves how or whence they
come, taking it for granted that they are
there, and that is enough. It is rather delightful
to see a hero, in whom one had begun
to take some interest, and whom he
supposed to be far distant, exposed to dangers
abroad and perfidy at home, all at
once stalk majestically in from the side
scene, and take his place before our eyes.
It gives the heart a great deal of relief to
see and know that he is there in person to
stand up for his own injured rights. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in our own case there is no such expedient.
Like the waggoner, we must return from
the top of the hill, and bring up those of
our characters that are left behind. At present
we must return from the top of the
great stair-case in Aikwood castle, into the
housekeeper's cell on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Charlie had made his escape almost unobserved;
those next to him weening that
he had only drawn a little back to keep a
due distance between the witch and him,
so that they pressed forward to the scene
without regarding him.</p>

<p>The crone continued her orgies, blowing
her fire one while, and again stirring
the liquid in the caldron; then making it
run from the end of a stick, that she might
note its state of gelidity. The friar addressed
her in his usual stile of sonorous
eastern eloquence; but she only regarded
him by a slight stare, and a motion with
her hand, as if she wished him and his group
to disappear. She had taken them for spirits
that she had conjured up, and perhaps
thought they were come before the time;
for in mumbling to herself, they at one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
heard her saying, "So you are all there,
are you? Well, I shall find you work. Sotter,
sotter my wee pan."</p>

<p>This scene went on for a considerable
time without any variety, the witch attending
solely to her caldron and her fire;
the friar standing before the flame, and
Tam and Gibbie, with their long kipper
noses, peeping over his shoulder. The
other three were behind these; the poet
with his arm round Delany's waist, and the
beautiful face of the boy Elias, the very
picture of amazement personified, appeared
below the friar's right arm. Scarcely
could such another group be formed for
the painter's eye. Here sat the witch, haggard
and wild, close at the one cheek of the
fire, watching over her caldron and infernal
morsel with the utmost eagerness.
There stood the gruff friar, with the keys
of the castle in his right hand, and the dim
lamp in his left, raised above his head; so
that, from the two groups of light, the
marked features of amazement could be
distinctly traced; which, with the faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and yellowish hue of their complexions,
made the whole highly picturesque.</p>

<p>The witch continued her occupation;
till, at length holding up her stick to note
the consistence of her jelly, that appeared
like boiling blood and water mixed, there
was something in its appearance that confounded
her. She dropt both her tube
and her stirring stick among the ashes, and
turned about staring wildly at our group.
She appeared as if examining their features
one by one in search of some one whose
presence she missed; and perceiving the
boy's face below the friar's arm, she fixed
her eyes on that, cowering down at the
same time like a cat that is about to spring
on its prey. Then, rising half up, she moved
toward him in a stooping posture, turning
always her face first to the one side
and then to the other, until her nose came
almost in contact with the boy's, on which
he slipped his face out of her sight behind
the friar's back. Observing next the two
droll faces over the friar's two shoulders,
she appeared delighted with the view; and
letting her jaws fall down, she smiled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it, but it was rather a gape than a smile.
She then tottered again towards the fire,
rocking her body and wagging her head as
before, repeating the while this unmeaning
phrase:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Niddy, noddy, niddy, noddy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three heads on ae body."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Haply she deemed all the three faces
she had seen belonged to the friar, and was
happy at witnessing such a monstrous appearance.</p>

<p>Sitting down on her hams as before, she
seized on her two implements, and began
to blow and stir for about the space of a
minute, testifying great impatience to see
how her spell proceeded. But the moment
that she held up a part of her morsel
on the stick, and let it drip off, she perceived
that all was wrong, and that her
guests were the reverse of those she expected.
As soon as she looked at the liquor,
she uttered a horrible scream, while
every joint of her body shook with fury;
and, lifting a wooden ladle that lay by her
side with devilish nimbleness, she splash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>ed
the boiling liquid on the faces and bodies
of our amazed compeers.</p>

<p>"Deil be in the auld jaud's fingers!"
cried Tam: "Gin she hasna jaupit out
baith my een!"</p>

<p>"I have indeed given my cheek to the
firebrand!" said the friar; "and the skin
of my forehead hath departed from me!"</p>

<p>"She brings me a-mind o' my mither,"
said Gibbie&mdash;but he got not time to proceed;
for after she had exhausted the contents
of her caldron on the intruders, she
attacked them with burning coals and
pieces of wood. These she dashed among
them with such desperate force, that
part of them sought refuge in retreat.
Not so our redoubted friar. He gave
the lamp out of his hand to the laird, bidding
him take care of it, and turning his
back toward her, and running backward
for fear of farther injury to his face and
eyes, he seized the witch by the frock, and
putting his arm round both hers to restrain
them, he held her fast to his side.
In doing so, he uncovered the cross that
hung at his girdle. When she saw this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and that her body was pressed against it,
she uttered the most horrified howlings,
and appeared to be falling into convulsions.
Nevertheless, the friar kept his
hold. He let her scream on, and, dragging
her toward the door, said unto her,
"Thou wicked one! as thy works have
been, so shall be thy reward; and as thou
hast sown, so also shalt thou reap. Come
with me, and I will put thee into a place
where thou shalt cease from troubling."</p>

<p>Without more ado, he bore her away
to the vault where lay her surly and unyielding
associate, beside his mass of dry
human bones; and forcing her in, he locked
them up together, saying, as he turned
the massy bolt, "Lo, the gates of iron and
of brass close upon thee! the bolts of steel
are drawn around thy dwelling! There
shalt thou remain, and there shall thy
flesh be consumed, unless thou repentest
thee of the evil that thou hast done."</p>

<p>There was a shrewd smile on the friar's
face as he said this, as of one who either
did not mean to put his threat in execution,
or marvelled how it was that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
should thus be lording it in the castle of
Aikwood, and imprisoning whom he would.</p>

<p>Never till that instant did any of the
party miss their friend and champion,
Charlie Scott; but when they turned from
the door of the prison to consult what was
to be done next, behold he was wanting
This caused them great dismay, but the
friar most of all.</p>

<p>"Wo is me!" cried he: "How is the
mighty departed, and the pillar of our
strength moved out of its place! As well
may they take my head from my body,
and say unto me live, as bid us go on and
prosper without that mighty man."</p>

<p class="break">The poor waggoner must again return
from the top of the hill, and bring up the
most important and weighty part of his cargo;
no less a load than muckle Charlie Scott,
laird of Yardbire, and the far famed warlock
and necromancer, Master Michael Scott.</p>

<p class="break">The mighty uproar that Charlie made
at the head of the stair, when he believed
the devil to be on the steps, aroused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
great necromancer from his nocturnal experiments,
all of which were of an infernal
kind. At such hours as these his capacious
mind was abstracted from all worldly
concerns, such as other mortals busy themselves
about. If any thing sublunary engaged
his studies and calculations, it was
how to make the living die and the dead
to live,&mdash;how to remove mountains out of
their places, to turn the sea into dry land,
and the fields into a billowy and briny
ocean,&mdash;or in any way counteract nature
in her goings on. In some of these great
enterprises was he doubtlessly engaged
that morning, when the voice of Charlie
Scott astounded his ears.</p>

<p>Often had hosts of demons mustered at
his call in the castle of Aikwood, and the
yelling sounds of the infernals were no
strangers to his ears; but never had he
heard such a potent voice before as that
sent forth by Charlie, when he conceived
himself cooped up between the devil and
a bolted door. Conceived did I say? No:
Charlie saw distinctly, by this time, an
indefinable being coming slowly up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
him. Saint Peter! as he did thresh the
warlock's door. "Is there any body here?
Hilloa! Open the door I say." Thump,
thump, thump!</p>

<p>The bolt inside was drawn, and, owing
to the strong pressure without, the door
flew wide open at once. Charlie perceiving
the light, and fearless of ought but
the figure behind him, rushed into the
room, and made toward the fire. The
door was instantly shut behind him with
a loud and furious clash; and Charlie then
turning around, got the first look of the
inmate. He was a boardly muscular man,
somewhat emaciated in his appearance,
with a strong bushy beard that flowed to
his girdle, of a hue that had once been jet
black, but was now slightly tinted with
grey. His eyes were uncommonly bright
and piercing, but they had some resemblance
to the eyes of a serpent. He wore
on his head a turban of crimson velvet,
ornamented with mystic figures in gold, and
on the front of it was a star of many
dazzling colours. The rest of his body
was wrapped in a mantle or gown, strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>ed
with all the hues of the rainbow, and
many more.</p>

<p>Charlie's eye had lately been lighted up
with terror, but as it fell on the majestic
figure of Master Michael Scott, its wild
gleam softened into respect, and he saluted
him with his quick, abrupt, border bow,
which rather resembled the motion made
by a raven beckoning from his rock as he
wakes the surrounding echoes, than the
slow and graceful courtesy then so well
understood among the great. Michael
still kept his erect posture at the back of
the door, fixing on our yeoman an indignant
and angry glance. That look conjured
up a little more of Charlie's breeding;
he doffed his steel bonnet with the
one hand, stroked down the hair of his
forehead with the other, and gave the
master another bow, or rather a nod.</p>

<p>"Gude e'en t'ye, Sir; I fancy you're
the lord o' this castle?" said Charlie.</p>

<p>"You fancy so, do you?" said the Master
with a sneer; and giving three tramps
with his heel on the floor, in one moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the three pages, Prig, Prim, and Pricker,
stood beside him.</p>

<p>"Work, Master, work,&mdash;what work
now?"</p>

<p>"Take that burly thief and housebreaker,
bind him, and put him to the
test."</p>

<p>"Stop short there, my good masters,
till I speak t'ye, said Charlie, "I'm neither
a housebreaker nor a thief, but a leel
man, our warden's kinsman, and your ain,
Master Michael Scott. I came here on
fair and honourable service, and I have been
guidit waur than a tike; and I'll just tell
you plainly, for I'm rather an e'en-down
chap, that if ane o' thae brats dare but to
touch me, I'll tak my hand aff his haffet
in sic a way that he sanna grene to lay
foul finger on a gentleman again."</p>

<p>The three pages fell a giggling at this
speech, and one of them brushed forward
and seized Charlie with a force of which
he had no conception. But he was one
that never suffered any personal attack
with impunity. He drew a stroke with his
clenched fist, and aimed such a blow at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the page's head, that, if he had had a head
like other pages, would have smashed it to
pieces. Charlie hit no head at all. He
struck a thing of nought. But the force of
his arm was such, that, about two yards
farther on, he hit an apparatus of curious
construction, which he called "a machine
for setting the wind on fire," and which he
made to fly all in flinders against the wall.
The Master's eye kindled with rage; but
the three urchins, who delighted in nothing
but mischief, laughed still the louder,
and pressed all forward on Charlie. He
had been a little astounded at missing the
page's head; but, being somewhat flustered,
he had not leisure to reflect, and his
conceptions were naturally none of the
most acute; so, for the present, he took it
for a miss. But seeing they purposed to
lay violent hands on him, he sprung back
into the middle of the room, in order to
command weapon space; and drawing out
the Eskdale souple, he stood on the defensive
in a most determined posture.</p>

<p>The pertinacious elves wheeled also
backward, taking a circle round behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the Master, and advanced on him all abreast.
Good Lord, with what might
Charlie struck at them! He came on them
with a hew that he meant should cut them
all three through the middle at once. But
he, a second time, struck on vacancy. The
sword whistled through the void, taking
Charlie round with it, and demolishing almost
every thing that was in the room.
The pages screamed with delight, but Michael
foamed with fury. Charlie paid no
regard either to him or the devastation he
had made among his utensils; but, springing
round the board to the other side of
the room, said, in a loud perturbed voice:
"Tell me just this ae thing, Michael,&mdash;are
thae three creatures deils? Because an they
be deils, I hae nae mair chance wi' them
than a cat. But as for yoursel, goodman,
I ken ye are flesh and blood, and o' my ain
kith and kin," (and with that he seized
Michael by the throat,) "therefore, either
gar thae hellicats gang about their business,
or, by Him that made us, I'll thraw
your neck about."</p>

<p>Whether it was the might of the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>chanter
himself, or that of his bond spirits,
Charlie wist not; but in one moment after
that his feet were tripped from beneath
him, and he was laid on his back on the
floor. There he was held by a might against
which his great strength could not
prevail, bound with cords, and stretched
on the board. The Master and his familiars
then conversed in Latin, a language
of which Charlie knew but little, having
never been at court; but he heard they
were conversing about his baptism. Charlie
had not got much time in his life to
think about these sacred rites, yet he had
always held them in proper respect and
veneration; and at that time he blessed the
hour he had been presented in holy church,
having strong hopes that on that account
the powers of hell would not prevail against
him. The elves loosed his buff-belt,
and unclasped his steel-doublet, laying his
manly bosom quite bare. The Master gave
them directions in Latin, and each of them
went and brought a long knife with two
edges, sharp as a razor, and having a point
like a lance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didna trow that there had been ought
sae misleared in nature as this," said Charlie.
"It's no that I'm ony feared for
death. I hae looked him ower often i' the
face to blench at his ca': but I wad just
hae liket to hae fa'en i' the field wi' my
sword i' my hand, and no to be cut up like
a Christmas pye, and carved a' into collops
by a wheen damned deils."</p>

<p>One of them prepared to cut open his
breast, and another his belly; but a moment's
dispute taking place between them
in some unknown tongue, about the mode,
as Charlie believed, he crossed himself as
well as he could with his bound hands,
and pronounced a sacred name into himself.
That instant he perceived the pages
fall a-trembling, and stand back; their
faces blenched with dread, and the weapons
fell from their hands. The Master
was wroth, and ordered them to proceed,
as Charlie weened by his motions; but,
instead of that, they retired trembling into
a corner. He snatched a knife from one
of them, as if determined to do the deed
himself. Charlie then deemed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
gone; for he had a sort of confused idea,
that, by certain laws of nature, and the use
of holy rites, wicked spirits were restrained,
else mankind would be destroyed:
"But what law of nature, or what holy
word or sign," thought he, "can restrain
the arm of a wicked man? It is my duty
to try, however," thought he again; and
with that he whispered a prayer to the Son
of the Virgin, that He would save a warrior
from a death like this.</p>

<p>Charlie's prayer was heard, short as it
was; for at that very moment, while yet
the syllables hung on his lips, entered the
gruff figure of the friar, with the keys of
the castle over his arm, and followed by
his associates.</p>

<p>"What seek you here, you dogs?" cried
the Master, turning about with the great
knife in his hand: "Am I thus to have
my privacy disturbed, and my abode ravaged
by a pack of carrion hounds from
the hills? Brave pages mine, bind them all,
and cut me them into a thousand pieces."</p>

<p>Scarcely was the order given ere they
had the poet on the floor, and bound with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
strong cords. The rest prepared to escape;
but the great enchanter placed his back
to the door, brandished his great knife,
and dared them to approach him. The
mettledness of these pages cannot be conceived,
far less described; they seemed but
to will a thing and it was done. Ere ever
one of the intruders had time to rally his
thoughts, or almost to think at all, three
of them and the boy were all lying bound
in fetters. But when the imps came to
seize on the friar, they could not. They
skipped about and about him, but they
had not power even to touch his frock.
The virgin stood behind him trembling;
and on their feeling their want of power
over the friar, they turned to lay hold on
her. But the moment they touched her
robe, they retired back in dismay.</p>

<p>Michael looked as if he dreaded there
was something about these two that boded
him no good; but he wist not what it was,
for he had never seen the prowess of his
bond spirits counteracted before; therefore
he awaited the event for a space, when
he perceived them vanquished.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The friar had time to rally his thoughts,
and remembered that the maid had the
blessed gospel concealed in her bosom; and
judging that these were perhaps fiends
with whom they had to do, who durst not
stand against the word of truth, he drew
his cross from below his frock,&mdash;that cross
which had been consecrated at the shrine
of Saint Peter, bathed in holy water, and
blessed with many blessings from the
mouths of ancient martyrs&mdash;had done
wonderous miracles in the hands of saints
of former days,&mdash;and lifting that reverendly
up on high, he pronounced the words
from holy writ against which no demon
or false spirit's power could prevail. In
one moment all the three imps fled yelling
from the apartment. The countenance
of the enchanter fell, and he quaked
where he stood; but the eye of the friar
was kindled up with exultation and joy.</p>

<p>"There worketh the hand of my master!"
exclaimed he: "There have I trusted,
and I am not, like thee, ashamed of
my trust. I have a strong-hold of hope,
and it is founded on a rock, but thy habi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>tation
trembleth beneath thee; and dost
thou know, or hast thou considered, what
is underneath?"</p>

<p>The friar then went up and loosed the
bonds of his friend Charlie, and of all the
rest, one by one, exulting in his creed, and
pouring forth such sentences of sublime
adoration as are not suited for an idle tale.</p>

<p>The Master at length took courage and
rebuked him, saying, "It is vain for thee,
foolish dupe of a foolish creed, to multiply
such great swelling words of vanity. What
though thy might hath, for once, prevailed
above my might, and thy spell proved
more powerful than mine? I will engage,
nevertheless, that in nine times out of ten,
mine, on fair trial, shall prevail over thine.
And at all events I can at this time call
in the arm of flesh to my assistance, and
do with you whatever seemeth to me
good."</p>

<p>"Ay, gude faith, and that's very true,
Master Michael Scott," said Charlie: "and
that we saw wi' our ain een. It is great
nonsense to quarrel with the lord of a castle
aneath his ain roof, although, I confess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
I was the first to do it mysel'. But there's
an auld saying, wha wad sit i' Rome and
strive wi' the pope? or misca' a Macdonald
in the raws o' Lochaber? We came
wi' nae sic intent, but in fair friendship,
and on courteous errand. And now when
we are a' rather on equal footing again,
let me beg o' you, great and powerful Master,
to be a reasonable man for aince. Answer
the warden's request, and let us gae;
for really, great Sir, our master canna well
want us; and mair nor that, I'm feared yon
chaps at the mill dinna gie Corby ony water."</p>

<p>Though the Master did not understand
the latter part of this speech, yet the honest
simplicity of Charlie somewhat interested
him. His stern and sullen brow
cleared to something like a smile; and on
looking at the singular and original group
before him, he half resolved within himself
to have some intercourse with humanity
once more. "If it were but for a day,
or even an hour," thought he, "would it
not form some variety in a life thus dedicated
to searching after hidden mysteries&mdash;a
life of turmoil and distraction, in which
there is no allay?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were some of the thoughts that
glanced on the dark mind of the necromancer,
as he turned his eye on the broad
weather-beaten face of honest Yardbire,
"And what may your master's request
be, yeoman?" said he.</p>

<p>Charlie had great hopes that he would
now bring matters to a bearing at once;
and, coming a step nearer to the Master,
he laid the one fore-finger across the other,
and answered him thus:&mdash;"Why, gude
faith, Sir, it is neither mair nor less than
just this:&mdash;Ye ken the last time ye war at
the castle of Mountcomyn, ye gae our
master, your kinsman, the warden, some
little insight anent things that were to come
about:&mdash;of some bits o' glebes, and hopes,
and glens, ye ken, that war to fa' to his
house. Now, Sir Knight, or Master, as I
should say, he's a man that, aboon a' ithers
that ever war born, looks to the honour
and the advantage o' his house. He's as
loyal as the day's light, as generous as a
corn mill, and as brave as a blast o' snaw or
a floody river. Od, you will turn either
the ane or the ither sooner than you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
turn him wi' his muirland callans at his
back.&mdash;Ay, I hae seen him.&mdash;But it's
needless to tell what he'll do for his ain.
So you see, Sir Master, that was the preceese
thing he sent us for."</p>

<p>"To send troops to his assistance, I perceive?"
said the Master.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Master, to say the truth, we
hadna that in charge; though it wad be
far mair mack like, and far mair feasible,
and far mair honourable into the bargain,
to send yon great clan o' ratten-nosed chaps
to help our master, than to hae them lying
idle, eating you out o' house and hauld
here. Ye wad aye be getting part o' the
spulzie. Half a dozen o' kye at a time now
and then disna do amiss. Sae, if you will
come to terms, I will engage for ane to
see you get fair share, to the hoof and the
horn, the barn an' the beef boat, the barrel
and the bed blanket. But, ye ken, Sir, in
matters like this, we maun do ae thing afore
another, like business men; and ye maun
be sae good, and sae kind, and sae obliging,
as to answer our first request first."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"As far as I can recollect," said Michael,
"I never heard any request made."</p>

<p>"Why, gude faith, Sir, ye ken, I believe
I forgot that part o't," said Charlie: "But
ye see, that's neither here nor there; for
the thing requires some explanation. Do
you ken a' this mad story about the siege
o' Roxburgh?"</p>

<p>"I trouble myself about no worldly
things," said the Master, "nor do I wish
to hear about them. Is there no one present
who can tell me this great business at
one breath?"</p>

<p>Charlie stepped back. "There's nae
garring him hae patience,&mdash;and good troth
my tongue I fear has outrun my logic," said
he: "Friar, speak you."</p>

<p>"Great and magnificent Master of Arts,"
said the friar, stepping forward, "whom
I have longed to see above all men! Lo,
thou seest, and thou hearest, that this man,
although he be a man of might, and a warrior
from his youth, is yet uncouth of
speech, and altogether diffuse; therefore
listen thou diligently unto the voice of thy
servant. Behold we are come to thee from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the man that ruleth over the borders of the
land, and leadeth forth his troops to battle.
He sendeth unto thee greeting, and
beseecheth to know of thee what shall befal
unto his people, and to his house, in the
latter days. It is thy counsel alone that
he asketh, for thou art renowned for wisdom
and foresight to the farthest corners
of the earth. The two nations are engaged
in great and bloody contest, and high are
the stakes for which they play. The man
who sent us intreateth of thee to disclose
unto thy servants who shall finally prevail,
and whether it behoveth him to join himself
to the captain of his people. He hath,
moreover, sent unto thee, by our hand,
these two beautiful captives, the one to be
thine handmaiden, and the other to be thy
servant and run at thy bidding; and whatsoever
thou requirest of our captain, that
will he do, even to the half of all that he
hath."</p>

<p>There was but one thing on earth by
which the wizard could be flattered, and
that was a deference to his profound art.
He therefore listened with patience to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
friar, and answered, that the request his
kinsman had made would take many days
to consider of: "For," said he, "I have
those to deal with that are more capricious
than the changing seasons, and more perverse
than opposing tides and winds; therefore
remain with me a few days, that I may
prove you."</p>

<p>"Od bless ye! Sir Master, the thing is
impossible!" said Charlie: "I coudna bide
frae my captain and chief, and him in jeopardy;
neither could I endure to think that
my poor beast should want water sae lang.
A man's life often depends on his beast."</p>

<p>"Thou givest us no meat," said the friar,
"nor wine nor strong drink givest thou
unto us. How, therefore, can we remain
in thine house? Nevertheless would I love
to abide a short time with thee, to witness
thy great might, before which the masters
of divinations in other lands have trembled.
Verily, I would also show unto thee what
thy servant can do."</p>

<p>"If I were to cope with such as thee,
it would only be to show thee thy littleness!"
said Michael. "But thy creed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
an abomination to me, and I abhor it. In
the meantime call up my steward, and I
will order him to provide you with meat
and drink."</p>

<p>The poet now, for the first time, spoke
up in the Master's hearing; and, indignant
at the steward's design on Delany, he delivered
himself with great vehemence.</p>

<p>"Nay, say not so, great Master. The
devil hath possession of that man, sure as
the stars burn on the morning's brow. He
give us meat or drink! Sooner he will
draw forth the crimson current from our
veins, and lay us with the dead: Sooner
he will rob beauty of her treasure, and deface
the image of his Maker. Let us go
forth to hill, or dale, or wood, strive with
the crow for carrion, or contend with owlets
for a mouse; but to be bearded by
that same surly beast, the heart of man not
brooks it. As for me, I lift my voice, my
absolute protest, against the degradation
and effect."</p>

<p>"He is indeed a son of Belial," said the
friar; "but I have put him in ward, that
he trouble us not. Lo, here be the keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of thy castle, which I intend to keep as
our surety. Therefore show me the place
where thy good things are disposed, and I
myself will be steward for a time; for indeed
that man of thine is such a son of Belial
that a man cannot speak to him."</p>

<p>The Master's brow lowered with dissatisfaction.
His subordinate spirits in whom
he trusted had no power over the friar,
and other man had he none within the
castle, save Gourlay, who was almost as
much fiend as man. He therefore intreated
the friar to set his steward at liberty,
and restore to him the keys, else no meat
or drink could be had; and, at the same
time, he gave them all warrandice that
they should be kindly used.</p>

<p>"My seneschal," said he, "is as stubborn
and froward as any demon of the pit,
nor will he do one kind or fair action save
by compulsion. But he dares not disobey
me. If he should presume to dispute my
orders in the slightest instance, one word
from you shall be sufficient, and I will shew
you how he shall be requited."</p>

<p>It was forthwith agreed that the Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
should accompany them down to the
dungeon, in order to restrain the fury
and violence of his servant. Matters
were therefore arranged, and the two prisoners
set at liberty. The steward was
sullen and intractable, lying still on the
dungeon floor, disregardful of the words
spoken to him by the friar; but when he
heard the Master's threatening accents he
sprung to his feet and came forth, looking
at Charlie in such a manner as plainly said,
"I shall be revenged on you."</p>

<p>The Master then took him to task,
demanding by whose orders he had shut
up his kinsman's friends in the vault. But
he only snarled and gnashed his teeth in
reply.</p>

<p>"And then to suffer yourself to be
mured up there!" said the Master.</p>

<p>"Ay," said Gourlay; "some have won
a tilt on the king of the field who never
saw the day to win it on another."</p>

<p>"For the viper blood that venoms thy
heart do thou ought amiss to these gentlemen,"
said the Master, "or to this obnoxious
thing that is their ward! Wherefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
let me ask, were they compelled to shut
you up there?"</p>

<p>The steward only grunted in reply; but
the poet came again boldly forward, having
been exasperated beyond measure at the
steward for his attempt on Delany; and
he said,&mdash;"Sir knight, in that I'll truly
counsel you. At dead hour of night, when
all was still, save the snell piping of the
frosty wind; even we were all at peace,
and quiet lay as did the dead man's bones,
but that, between, the friar at equal intervals
sent forth his nasal roar, so vehement
that the mice, yea, and the starveling rats,
ceased from their prowling, listened the
dire sound from fleshy trumpet of our mother
church, then sought, with stretched
forth tail, and nimble foot, the depth profound!
There quaking did they lie, like
fiends driven from the height to the abyss,&mdash;lank
make, chilled heart, and grievous
length of tail. At that ill hour, in comes
this boding owl, this ill-starred man of
sin, and straight demands that peerless
maiden for your honour's couch. Him
we refused&mdash;the maiden shrieked for help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&mdash;he
dragged her forth, and on this laurelled
head, crowned by the muses with celestial
bays, inflicted ruthless wound. The bedesman
also fell; but he our friend, the Hector
of the hills, wrought his o'erthrow, and circum-mured
him. Thus my say is ended."</p>

<p>The Master, as the poet spoke, seemed
several times so much amused that they
expected he would have burst into laughter.
But one look of his eye spoke sentences.
When he heard that Gourlay had
demanded the maid for him, he gave him
such a glance as made the wretch almost
cower to the earth; and when the poet
ended he turned his eyes on Charlie, measuring
him from head to foot, and seeming
as if he doubted the fact that he or any
man could master his redoubted seneschal.
However, the Master had seen so much of
the group, that he determined, contrary to
his custom, to have some amusement with
them. He therefore ordered his seneschal
forthwith to provide all good things for
their entertainment.</p>

<p>The stubborn wight made no movement
betokening obedience. He stood upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with his dull white face a little elevated,
and his eyes turned up below his brows,
while those who were next him heard him
saying to himself, in accents that creaked
in his throat, "Hell must be moved for this
repast!" The Master heard not this sentence,
but noting his steward's indecision,
he stamped with his foot, and pointing
with his finger, the latter led the way into
an antichamber of the same cold and naked
appearance with the rest of the apartments
of the castle, where, leaving them
with a light, the two went away into the
great Master's dormitory, "To cast their
cantrips, and bring up the deil."</p>

<p>"He keeps an unco cauld house this
carl," said Tam, when they were left by
themselves: "I fancy he'll ken brawly
he'll hae ane bien eneugh at the hinder-end,
and downa bide to see fire in this!"</p>

<p>"He brings me a-mind o' daft Jock
Amos i' the Goosegreen," said Gibbie,&mdash;"wha
never durst lie down on a bed because
his mother died on ane. Whenever he
saw a bed wi' white sheets on it he fell a-trembling,
and ran to the gate."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p>The morning had by this time dawned
on the gray hills of the forest, and that
with an aspect gloomy and foreboding.
The white snowy clouds had crept down
into the bosoms of the hills; and above
these clouds were here and there to be seen
the top of a mountain crested with its dark
cairn, so that the heavens and the earth
seemed to be mingled together.</p>

<p>"Gude sauf us!" cried Charlie, as he
peeped out at his small crannied window,
"but this is a grim, gousty-looking morning!
I wish the prince o' the air be nae
fa'en a brewing some o' his hellish storms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and hairikens on us. If there be spirits
moving about on thae hills to-day, they
can be nae good anes, ye may see by their
look out. Sant Mary be with us! see their
drumly heads appear to be raised to double
their ordinary height."</p>

<p>"Be not thou afraid, my son, of the
prince of the power of the air, for there is
one that is greater than he," said the friar;
"and though the fiends may for a while
muster their fogs, and foment the air with
storms, yet will he send forth his angels
and scatter them; yea, he will send them
forth riding on the whirlwind, and the
clouds of heaven shall be their chariots,
and the powers of darkness shall fly in dismay
before them."</p>

<p>The friar stepped forward to the window,
and gazed for a minute in breathless astonishment;
then turning away, he added in
a solemn tone, "Verily, my children, I am
afraid to look at the face of the sky, or to
behold the hues that are abroad on the firmament
this day, though my strength be
the munition of rocks."</p>

<p>The steward now appeared with his rod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of office in his hand, and, with all due ceremony,
marshalled his guests up the great
stair, and finally up a small winding stair,
to an apartment at the very top of the upmost
tower, above all the turrets and paved
battlements. This room was in a blaze of
light with flaming torches all around; and
(joyful sight to our precious embassy!) the
table was covered with rich viands in great
abundance. The friar, having got short of
breath in his ascent, lagged considerably
behind, while the foremost rushing in,
every one began to help himself with the
greatest avidity; so that, when the friar at
length came puffing into the apartment,
all the rest had begun without grace. The
seat at the foot of the table was still unoccupied;
and before that there stood a beautiful
smoking sirloin of beef, with a gentle
brown crust around it, and half swimming
in gravy. Never was there a more delicious
sight presented to a hungry man.</p>

<p>The worthy friar, seeing all the rest engaged,
would not risk a trespass on good
manners by interrupting them, although
it was an established custom with him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
bless every meal before tasting it. In
conformity with this venerable custom
among Christians, he lifted up his spread
hands, closed his eyes, and leaning forward
above the beef so closely that he actually
breathed upon it, and felt the flavour
of health and joy ascending by his nostrils,
in that fervent and respectful attitude he
blessed the beef in the name of Jesus.
Never had blessing a more dolorous effect.
When the friar opened his eyes, the beef
was gone. There was nothing left on the
great wooden plate before him but a small
insignificant thing resembling the joint of
a frog's leg, or that of a rat; and perhaps
two or three drops of gravy.</p>

<p>The friar's associates were all busily engaged.
The steward was moving about
behind them, and at that time happened
to be passing by near where the friar sat;
of course, this latter worthy had no doubt
whatever but that the malicious old rascal
had stolen the roast slyly from under his
nose the moment that his eyes were closed,
whereas the steward was as much astounded
as he. It was a fine picture. The friar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
had placed himself hastily to begin; but,
missing his beef, and seeing nothing of it
on the board, he was moved with great
anger and indignation. There he sat, biting
his lip, and having his deep dark eye
fixed on the seneschal; and there stood the
tall seneschal, with his mouth wide open,
his face half raised toward the cornice of
the chamber, and his dull heavy eye fixed
on the friar's plate. He was in utter dismay;
for he dreaded that, on such a blessing
being pronounced openly, the whole
of his provisions would in like manner
vanish away; and he was a blithe man
when, instead of blessing, the friar, on
opening his mouth, was rather inclined to
curse.</p>

<p>"Cursed be thy malice, for it is great,"
cried he: "Thou Nabal! thou Rabshakeh!
thou Shimei, the son of Bichri! thou Er!
thou Onan! thou vile Judas, the son of
Simon! Magormissabub be thy name; and
may it be blotted out after thee, and become
a bye-word, and a proverb, and a
hissing among people and children. Restore
that which thou hast unjustly taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
away, before I thrust my sword into thee,
and take away thy life. Give unto me
the precious morsel thou hast taken away,
or, lo! thou art in the jaws of destruction,
and the pit openeth her mouth wide upon
thee."</p>

<p>The steward answered neither good nor
bad; for he was afraid of the vengeance of
his master, and the evil spirits that wrought
at his bidding, and delighted in nothing
so much as in tormenting him, else had
he not taken the friar's curses without repaying
them sevenfold. He therefore shut
his mouth, and closed his eyes, putting on
a countenance of the utmost derision. But
the friar's heart had been set upon the
beef, his soul had rejoiced over it, and he
could not with patience give way to the
idea of losing it; therefore, instead of joining
the rest, who were devouring their
various fare with great eagerness, he continued
his anathemas on the steward.</p>

<p>"Blethering gouk!" cried Charlie: "Can
nae ye tak part o' what's gaun, and haud
your jaw? What signify a' thae strings
o' gospel phrases at sic a time as this?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Will they fill a hungry stamock, or mak
the worthy seneschal either better or waur
than he is? Come pledge me in a cup o'
wine to the health of our great landlord,
Master Michael Scott."</p>

<p>They handed the stoup down to the
friar, who filled for himself, and took the
pledge, though still with a gloomy and a
discontented brow. He then left his seat,
and went up one side of the board, close
to Gibbie Jordan, where he began a-helping
himself to a slice, from a mangled
shoulder of venison apparently. But it
relished not,&mdash;for still the lost beef was
uppermost in his mind, and his eye glanced
hot displeasure at the steward.</p>

<p>"Surely he is of all men the most accursed,"
added he: "He drinketh up malice
as the ox drinketh up water; and as
his name is so is he. Whereunto he hath
conveyed the morsel that I loved, is a matter
too high for me to comprehend. I see
it not in any corner of the habitation, nor
doth the smell of it reach my nostrils. But
I will visit it upon his head; and mine eyes
shall see my desire on him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The dishes of meat were, however, of
good quality, and well mixed with fat and
lean; yet none of them knew exactly what
they were, neither would the sullen steward
deign to give them the least information
on that head. There was even one large
shapeless piece, of a savour and consistence
so peculiar that no one of them could tell
whether it was flesh or fish. Still they
continued their perseverance, devouring
one dish after another, and drinking off
one stoup of wine after another, without
any abatement of appetite on the one side
or any exhiliration of spirits on the other,
the steward always bringing in a supply
with the most perfect equanimity. At
length our yeomen began to look at one
another. Their hands had waxed weary
with cutting, and their jaws would scarcely
any more perform their office.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, my
brethren," said the friar: "Surely it is
better for us to desist, lest our table prove
a snare unto us. Lo, my hands are weary,
and my cheek-bones are pained even to
their utmost extremities. Verily, it is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
vanity, for my body is only filled as with
the east wind."</p>

<p>"Na, na; ply away. It's good sport.
I dinna see how we can be better employed,"
said the deil's Tam.</p>

<p>"I think, my brethren, that we should
from eating straight refrain," said the poet;
"for eating is but weariness, and drinking
is but pain. There is no strength into
our bread, nor spirit in our wine: some
warlock wight has ta'en the might out of
this food of mine."</p>

<p>The steward had all this time never
spoken word good or bad; but had served
them with the utmost obsequiousness;
and when they had at length ceased from
feeding, he went and gave the Master an
account of the repast, which proved a
source of great divertisement to him.</p>

<p>"I have not," said he, "for these many
years, had any desire to trifle with the beings
to whose species I once belonged; but this
group surpasses all of their kind. I will,
therefore, lay aside my profound studies,
and be with them as one of themselves. If
it were but to torment them, I will indulge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in this idle and vain humour. I have almost
forgot how human passions work."</p>

<p>"I pray of thee, Master," said Gourlay,
"that thou wilt suffer me to slay yon grim
and snarling dog in the grey frock. I
loathe, hate, and abhor him. He is, moreover,
a bit of a necromancer himself; and
has the insolence to suppose that he can
rival you in power."</p>

<p>"It is there I long to try him," said
the Master. "In power I brook no rival
in this or any other land, as thou thyself,
and thy wretched companion in bondage,
can witness. There is only one thing in
this weak man in shape of a friar that I
fear, and that thing shall be nameless.
Perhaps I may commission thee to take
him away. In the mean time, remove the
remainder of their wretched viands, and
bring me in a vessel full of the strong
wine of Palestine, mixed up with the essence
of many spirits. It is a beverage
fit for gods. In it will I pledge these deranged
mortals; and thou shalt see some
sport for once, if aught on earth can divert
thee."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certes I shall be diverted, great Master
of arts. I hope you will favour them
with a touch of <i>the varieties</i>, by way of
example?"</p>

<p>"By and by, Gourlay,&mdash;all in good
time. In the mean while, let us deal with
them as men and as gentlemen; and, before
I metamorphose them into quadrupeds,
let us see what kind of beings they
will make of themselves."</p>

<p>The Master accordingly entered the
room, where his guests still sat round the
board. All of them rose, and made obeisance;
but, without returning the courtesy,
he took his seat at the end of the
table next to the door, and was just about
to address them, when he was interrupted
by Charlie Scott. There were two great
individuals always uppermost in Charlie's
mind,&mdash;these were his master the warden,
and his horse Corby; and finding himself
again in the Master's presence, and thinking
he rather looked better pleased than
he was wont, he judged it prudent not to
let the opportunity slip: so, after scratch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>ing
his head violently with both hands, he
thus preferred his solicitation:</p>

<p>"Gude faith, Master Scott, I'm glad I
hae seen you again; and, nae disparagement
either to you or your house, Sir
Knight, but the truth is, we canna bide
here. For, in the first place, you see, our
skins will gang to the bauks in a jiffey;
and, in the next place, our captain, the
warden, canna want us. It is far mair
than our lives are worth for us to stay
here; for, troth, Sir Master, the lives o'
others depend on it. Now, I wadna like
that we were trowed to be corbie messengers.
And that brings me a-mind, Sir
Knight, how muckle need I hae to be at
the mill down by there. I hae a friend
at it that I fear is in nae good plight."</p>

<p>"Content you, gallant squire, for a
space," said the Master; "I do intend to
answer the request of my noble kinsman
with all expedition; but such things cannot
be done in a moment. I must read
the face of the heavens, and listen to the
voices from the deep below. I have likewise
a master to consult; he has another;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and both are as perverse as hell itself. Be
content, therefore, and enjoy yourselves
for the remainder of this day. Give me
all your names that I may register them,
and give me them truly."</p>

<p>Every one gave his name and designation,
save that the poet gave the name of the
lovely Delany with an encomium on her
beauty and virtue. But Michael cared for
none of those things. What appeared beautiful
in the eyes of other men, to his were
loathsomeness and deformity. Far different
was the case when the friar announced
his own name.</p>

<p>Michael started to his feet, and, with
spread hands, and every feature of his
countenance dilated with joy, he exclaimed,
"What? Primate of Douay in France,
and author of the Book of Arts?"</p>

<p>"The same, great Sir," said the friar:
"I confide it to you: But haply thou dost
not know, in this thy retired habitation,
that men thirst for my blood; that I am
a persecuted man, and have suffered imprisonments,
bonds, wounds, yea, and tor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>tures;
that I have been hunted from nation
to nation, and from land to land, until
I found shelter and protection among
these wild and reckless Borderers, a people
that neither fear God nor regard man.
With them have I taken up my abode. I
am become a father to them, and they are
as children unto me. I love them. But,
if they should be induced to give me up,
wo would be unto me!"</p>

<p>"What d' ye say, man?" said Charlie,
grasping his hand. "D' ye think a Scot
amang us wad gie you up? If there be sic
a man in the Border array, he ought to be
d&mdash;ned. But I trow I ken a bit o' the
warden's mind there; and I can tell you,
a' the pens and a' the rapiers in England
wadna gar him gie up the gospel friar.
Na, na; if ever he's gien up, he maun gie
up himsel, and mak his ain conditions too."</p>

<p>"Great and notable Primate, you are
welcome to this castle," said the Master;
"whether by the title of monk, prior, primate,
or friar, I say you are welcome here.
I have ridden a thousand miles to meet
with you. But that is long agone. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
heard of your great skill in the sublime
arts, that surpass the comprehension of ordinary
men, and I determined to stake my
life on the trial of skill between us. I was
disappointed in meeting with you, for you
were not to be found, dead or alive. The
days of my ambition are fled. My power
has been acknowledged so long, none daring
to contend with me, that indifference
hath ensued; after that came disgust, and
with it misery. Thou art the man of all
the earth whose fame I have envied; and,
if thou darest, I will contend with thee,
for freedom or for life, which thou wilt.
If thou art overcome, thou shalt be my
bondsman and slave, and if thou conquerest
I will submit to be thine."</p>

<p>"Lo, I will contend with thee even for
name and being," said the friar. "Of the
strong-holds of sin and Satan am I not
afraid. I have put the ministers of thy
vengeance to flight already, and I will
chase, yea, I will overcome and pursue
them away; as chaff is driven before the
wind, will I scatter them. Dare not to
contend with me; for, if I judge aright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
my Master holdeth thine in chains, and if
I interfere thou canst do nothing. I judge
it therefore best to contend as brothers
contend. To admire what is truly great,
and deride that which is insignificant.
Mine are the arts of peace, truth, and
righteousness, and I hoped thine were the
same."</p>

<p>"Why, art thou not a monk, a follower
of the wretched maniac, Benedict of Padua?
that driveller in hidden mysteries?"
said the Master. "I do not rightly
comprehend thee, or by what power thou
didst thwart my servants. Tell me in one
word,&mdash;Art thou not in combination with
the potent elemental spirits that rule and
controul the earth, the air, the fire, and
the waters? If not, thy arts are superficial
and worthless."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt see, and thou shalt judge,"
said the friar: "I am not ashamed of that
I can do." And with that he went and
brought up his huge portmanteau, in
which he always carried many a small and
curious apparatus; but these he kept carefully
concealed, having suffered so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
from the superstitions of bigotted and illiterate
men, in the course of his profound
researches. He was the greatest chemist
that had ever appeared on the stage of existence;
yet that curious and refined art
was he obliged carefully to conceal, having
been persecuted as a necromancer over
every kingdom of southern Europe.</p>

<p>When he went away Charlie Scott was
terribly in the fidgets. He expected instantly
to witness the raising of the devil,
and other infernal spirits, against whom
he cherished the most inveterate dislike.
His eyes began to set in his head, and the
roof of his mouth became so dry that he
could not pronounce words distinctly.</p>

<p>"Gude faith, Sir Master," said he, "I
dinna appruve of a man setting up his
birse, and braving a gentleman in his ain
house. And, wi' your permission, I hae
something o' great importance to do at the
mill; sae I'll e'en step down that length,
and I shall come up again' the morning by
day-light."</p>

<p>"Please to remain with your friends,
good yeoman," said the Master: "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
shall witness something worth your while.
What can you possibly have to do at the
mill?"</p>

<p>"Muckle, muckle to do at the mill, Sir
Knight; I'll just refer it to yoursel,&mdash;can
either man or beast leeve wanting drink?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the Master:
"I had almost forgot my principal errand.
Gourlay, fill me a glass of the wine of Palestine."</p>

<p>The steward did as he was ordered; and
the Master, taking the cup, drank to the
health of his kinsman, the warden, and all
his friends. Every one of his guests did
the same, save the maiden and boy; and
every eye was cleared, and every heart
warmed, for the liquor was as strong as
brandy.</p>

<p>"Weel, Sir Knight," said Charlie, "that
is what ane wad ca' rather stiff sturdy
drink; I hae nae tasted ought as weel
worth the drinking: And if ye will just gar
auld Crossgrains come ower us again, I
think I could even prevail on mysel' to
face the deil, and let Corby tak his chance."</p>

<p>The request was instantly complied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with. Each of them got another cup; and
the friar having tarried a while to put his
affairs in order, when he came back the
tongues of all his companions were going
at once, and he was apprehensive that they
were bewitched. He, however, took the
pledge in one full cup, and was greatly revived
by it; but refused taking another
at that time.</p>

<p>The room in which they sat was lighted
by four windows: those to the east and
west were small circular ones, having a
pane of bright glass in each: those to the
north and south were merely long slits in
the wall, without any glass; and the first
thing the friar did, before producing the
specimens of his art, was to close up all
these windows, so as to exclude the light
of day, and the glass of the western one
he either contrived to remove, substituting
another in its place, or else he put another
piece of magnifying glass over it.</p>

<p>When he began a-closing up the last,
Charlie entered a vehement protest against
it, on the ground that no body would see
what he did, or what he raised, and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
one might be seized by the neck ere ever
he was aware, by some o' his infernal deils.</p>

<p>"I hate a' surprises," added he; "It's
best keeping the crown o' the fell, and seeing
weel about ane. Room to fight and
room to flee, an ye like, Maister Gospel-friar.
Wha do you think's gaun to play
at hide-and-seek wi' the deil in sic a place
as this?"</p>

<p>The Master, in a sneering manner, requested
that the great enchanter might
have his own way: and Charlie, whose
tongue was a little loosed by the wine of
Palestine, was at last restrained, though
not without a good deal of grumbling and
fidgetting. The room was darkened; the
friar went into a small alcove, and, by the
help of a magic lanthorn, a thing never
before seen in Scotland, he raised up a tremendous
and horrid figure on the wall. It
was of gigantic size; its eyes, lips, and
paws moved; and its body was thrown
into various contortions.</p>

<p>All were in breathless silence on the appearance
of this extraordinary shade; but
among the darkling group there was dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>tinctly
heard one whose breathing was frequently
cut short, as if something had been
choking him, or seizing him by the throat.</p>

<p>After the apparition had gone through
its various evolutions, all apparently at the
further end of the apartment, it fixed its
eyes, clenched its teeth, and, stretching
forth its claws, it appeared to make a spring
forward at the party.</p>

<p>"Aih! L&mdash;d be here!" cried Charlie in
a trumpet voice, and threw himself flat
down behind the rest. Hearing that some
of them laughed at the fright he had got,
he ventured to speak and expostulate a
little; but no curiosity could induce him
to raise his face from the floor, or open his
eyes again while the friar's exhibition continued.
"Lair him, lair him, friar!" cried
he,&mdash;"or, od, I's be about your lugs some
day for this. Lair him, lair him, in the
name of St Michael! and if that winna
do, try him wi' Peter&mdash;he'll send him ower
the battlements like a shot. O good friar,
whatever ye do, lair him!"</p>

<p>The friar went on with his phantasmagoria.
The figure, after giving a shiver or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
two, was parted into three, all of the same
form and size, but all making different
motions, and different contortions of feature.
The three were afterwards parted
into six, which, among other grotesque
feats, danced a reel, and, on running thro'
it, every one threw itself heels-over-head.
The group of onlookers laughed outright
at this, notwithstanding their astonishment,
and called to Charlie to look. But
he would not move his face from the earth,
and only asked, in a half-suffocated voice,
"Is he no laired yet? Od I shall be about
wi' that cursed body for his tricks."</p>

<p>When the friar had concluded this feat,
he put out his small lanthorn, took the machinery
out of it, concealing it beneath his
ample frock, and again opened all the windows.</p>

<p>Charlie got up, and running to one of
the loop-holes, "Gude be thankit, I'll get
a cooke o' the air o' heaven again!" said
he, "for I hae been breathing fire and
brimstone this while byegane. Foul befa'
me gin ever I saw the like o' yon; I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
sair dumfoundered,&mdash;but wha could stand
afore the face of a fiery giant?"</p>

<p>The friar's associates looked at the lanthorn,
examining it with curious eyes, but
perceived nothing about it which could in
any way account for the apparition they
had seen. Master Michael Scott did not
deign to ask a sight of it, but paced over
the floor in sullen and thoughtful mood.
The seneschal stood fixed to the spot on
which he had witnessed the phenomenon,
with his heavy unmoving eyes turned towards
his master. He seemed dubious
whether he was vanquished or not. The
Master at length spoke, addressing the
friar:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope, right worshipful Primate, this
is not the extent of your knowledge and
power in the sublime art of divination?
The whole is only a delusion,&mdash;a shadow,&mdash;a
phantom, calculated to astonish women or
children. I acknowledge it to be ingenious;
still it is nothing. You multiplied
your shadows, turning three into six;
now, if I turn three men into six living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
breathing, substantial beings, will you acknowledge
yourself outdone?"</p>

<p>"Certes, I will," said the friar.</p>

<p>"Away, then, with deception," said the
Master: "What I do, I do in the open
eye of day.&mdash;Stand forth three of you."</p>

<p>"Master Michael Scott, I'll tell you
what it is," said Charlie, "I solemnly protest
against being parted into twa."</p>

<p>"You shall neither suffer nor feel the
least inconvenience by the change, brave
yeoman," said the Master; "therefore be
not afraid, but stand forth."</p>

<p>Charlie hung his head to one side in a
deep reverie, till at length his countenance
lightened up by degrees, his features opening
into a broad smile.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Sir Knight,"
said he, "if you will assure me that baith
o' us shall be as stout and as wight chaps
as I am mysel e'en now, gude faith, I dinna
care though ye mak me into twa, for
my master the warden's sake. If you could
double an army that gate, it wad be a great
matter. I doubt sair I'll cast out wi' my
tither half about something that I ken o',<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and that's Corby; but I'll run the risk.
Nane o' your cutfing and cleaving, however,
Sir Knight. Nane o' your imps wi'
their lang-kail gully knives again."</p>

<p>Charlie stepped up the floor, and took
his stand with his back at the wall, to await
doggedly this multiplication of himself.
Tam soon joined him: but there was
a hard contest between Gibbie and the
poet, both of whom were rather personal
cowards, and both alike averse to such experiments.
The former was at length obliged
to yield, for Carol clung so close
to the maid, that nothing could induce
him to part from her; and, ever since the
friar gave him the grievous overthrow, he
had lost all confidence in his personal
prowess.</p>

<p>Michael stamped thrice with his heel,
and spoke some words in an unknown
tongue, in a low muttering tone; but some
of them heard the sounds of Prig, Prim,
and Pricker. There was a momentary
confusion in the apartment. A darkening
haze flashed over it, and blinded the eyes
of men for a short space; the floor gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
shake, as if it had sunk down a little,&mdash;and
there stood two of each of the three friends,
so completely alike that no one knew who
was who.</p>

<p>No scene could be more truly ludicrous
than the one which now ensued; each
man turned to his prototype, and the looks
of confusion and astonishment in both being
the same, the beholders were seized
with irrepressible laughter.</p>

<p>Charlie felt his legs, thighs, and ribs, if
they remained the same as before. The
other boardly personage in the same shape
followed his example, and added, "Gude
faith, the like o' this I saw never!"</p>

<p>"You may weel say't," said the other;
"But let me see if you can draw that lang
sword as weel an' as cleverly as I can do."</p>

<p>"Gude Lord, hear til him!" said the
first: "He's speaking as he were the true
Charlie Scott himsel! Speak ye, friend:
Were you me before this! That, is, did
you ride with the warden over the border?"</p>

<p>"I am sure if you were there, I never
saw you before," said the second speaker;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"But I dinna ken what I am saying; for
the truth is I dinna comprehend this."</p>

<p>With that they again gazed at each
other, and looked over their shoulders, as
if they would not have cared to have fled
from one another's presence.</p>

<p>With every pair the scene was much the
same. Tam was so much astonished that
he turned to his second self, cowered down,
leaning his hands upon his knees, and made
a staunch point at him. The other took
precisely the same posture, so that their
long noses almost met. The maid, the poet,
and the boy screamed with laughter. Both
of the Tams laughed too, so that they very
much resembled an ideot looking at himself
in a glass.</p>

<p>"Friend, I canna say but ye're very
like me," said Gibbie to his partner; "But,
though nane o' us be great beauties, ye
look rather the warst o' the twae."</p>

<p>"It brings me a-mind o' a story I hae
heard my mother tell," said the other, "of
a lady and her twa Blackamores"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What the deil man!" exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
first; "Did your mother tell that story
too?"</p>

<p>"Ay; wha else but she tauld it? I say
my mother, auld Effy Blakely of the Peatstacknowe."</p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;She your mother? It is gayan
queer if we be baith ane after a'! for I never
had a billy."</p>

<p>The two Gibbies then both began to
tell stories, which each claimed as originally
his, so that the perplexity still increased.
Nor was it better when the parties began
to mix and address each other. All
spoke of themselves as the right and proper
persons, and of the others as beings in
their likenesses, and the most complete
uncertainty prevailed. But, just as the
novelty and interest of the drama began
to subside, Michael, by a wave of his hand
annihilated the three additional personages,
and all remained as it was before the
grand exhibition commenced, save that our
group had got a new topic of conversation
and merriment.</p>

<p>"Primate of Douay, so celebrated for thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
mighty enchantments, how thinkest thou
of this?" said the Master.</p>

<p>"That thou hast done what no man
could have done beside," said the friar;
"and that thy power even surpasseth
that of the magicians of Egypt, and of
those of the countries in the lands of the
east. But in one thing my power is even
as thy power. Dost thou know that I
could have prevented thy charm, and put
a period to thy enchantment at my will
and pleasure?"</p>

<p>"It is not the power of prevention that
we are trying," said the Master. "Suffer my
servants to do their work, as I shall suffer
thine, and we shall then see who are most
punctually obeyed, and who shall perform
the greatest works. Only, if I prevail in
all things, you will surely have the generosity
to acknowledge that my master is
greater than thine?"</p>

<p>"Wo be unto me if such a confession
proceed out of my lips!" said the friar:
"Who can be greater than he who builded
the stories of heaven, and laid the foundations
of this earth below; who lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
up the sun, sending him abroad in brightness
and in glory, and placed the moon
and the stars in the firmament on high?
Who is greater than he who hath made
the mountains to stand, the seas to roll,
and the winds to blow? who hath not only
made the souls of men, but all the spirits
of the upper and nether world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, thou maniac!" cried the Master,
interrupting the friar, in a voice that
made him leap from the floor: "Comest
thou here to babble treason against the
master whom I serve, and the mighty spirits
with whom I am in league? Do what
thou canst do, and cease from speaking
evil of dignities. What knowest thou of
the principalities and powers that inhabit
and rule over the various regions of the
universe? No more than the mole that
grovelleth beneath the sward.&mdash;What further
canst thou do in proof of thy profound
art?"</p>

<p>"Behold with thine eyes, O thou who
accountest thyself the greatest among the
children of men!" said the friar, with a
waggish air; "that I will but speak the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
word, and the mountains shall be rent asunder,
and the tops of the everlasting
hills stand in opposition. Knowest thou
the proper name, figure, and dimensions
of that peaked mountain over against the
castle, to the west?"</p>

<p>"Well may I know it," said the Master,
"for I have looked out on it these
fifty years, and many a hundred times
have I followed the chase around it. It is
named Cope-Law, and the mountain is my
own."</p>

<p>"Mountain of Cope-Law, hear my
voice," cried the friar in the same waggish
tone, in which there was an affectation of
sublime command: "Thou hast borne the
footsteps of thy great master and his black
horse Beelzebub, yet hast thou neither been
scorched nor rent. Yea though he hath
cursed thee in the bitterness of ire, yet
hath thy grey head never been shaken.&mdash;But,
behold, a greater than thy master is
here. Mountain of Cope-Law, hear my
voice:&mdash;Be thou rent asunder and divided
into three, that thy owner may look on
thee and be astonied. If it please thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
mighty magician, look out on thy mountain
of Cope-Law now."</p>

<p>Many a thousand times had the Master
looked out at that circular window; every
bush and grey stone on the hill were familiar
to him; and, all unsuspicious of the
simple deceit that had been practised on
him, he went and looked forth from the
window, when, in the place where one
round peaked mountain was wont to be,
he actually saw three, all of the same dimensions;
and, as he weened, each of them
more steep, tall, and romantic than the
original one had been. He looked, and
looked again&mdash;the optical delusion was
complete. He paced the floor in sullen
mood; muttered some sentences to
himself in an under tone, and once more
looked forth on the singular phenomenon.
The mountains remained the same. They
could not be seen from any other window,
and no one thought of descending to the
great balcony; so that in the eyes of all the
friar remained triumphant.</p>

<p>The Master could not brook this. He
strode the floor in gloomy indignation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and at length they heard him saying, "If
I should venture to demand it&mdash;But is it
then to be my last great work? The demand
is dreadful!&mdash;I will&mdash;I'll demand it.
Never shall it be said that Michael Scott
was out-done in his own art, and that by a
poor peddling friar. Come all of you hither,"
added he in a louder tone. "Look
at that mountain to the east. It is known
to you all&mdash;the great hill of Eildon. You
see and know that it is one round, smooth,
and unbroken cone."</p>

<p>"We all know it, and have known it
from infancy," was the general answer.</p>

<p>The Master gave three strokes with his
heel, and called the names of his three elfin
pages, who in an instant stood before
him.&mdash;"Work, Master, work,&mdash;what work
now?"</p>

<p>"Look at that mountain to the east,"
said he, "ycleped the hill of Eildon. Go
and twist me it into three."</p>

<p>The pages grinned, looking at him with
eyes of a devilish gleam, as a ravenous creature
eyes its prey.</p>

<p>"The hill is a granite rock," said one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&mdash;"and
five arrow-flights high," said another,&mdash;"and
seventy round the base," said
the first.</p>

<p>"All the powers of earth, and hell to
boot, are unmeet to the task," added the
third.</p>

<p>"Thou art a proud and impertinent
liar, perverse imp of the regions of flame,"
said the Master: "Note this, The thing
must, and shall be done; even though a
body and soul should both be given up as
the guerdon. I know my conditions; they
are sealed, and subscribed, and I am not to
be disobeyed. Get to your work without
more hesitation."</p>

<p>The three pages then fell to reeling about
and about, singing a wild and uncouth
trio, in words of the following import:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Pick and spade<br /></span>
<span class="i8">To our aid!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Flaught and flail,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Winds arise, and tempests brattle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you will the thunders rattle.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Come away<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Elfin grey,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Much to do ere break of day!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come with spade, and sieve, and shovel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come with roar, and rout, and revel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come with crow, and come with crane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strength of steed, and weight of wain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crash of rock, and roar of river;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if you will, with thunders shiver!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Come away,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Elfin grey;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much to do ere break of day!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they sung these last lines they reeled
out at the door in a circular motion, so
rapid that the eye dazzled which looked
on them. The poet, drawn involuntarily
by the ears after that wild fairy lay, hasted
out after them. He looked east, and west,
and all around, but he only saw three
crows winging their flight toward the hill
of Eildon.</p>

<p>From the time of their departure the
temper of the great Master became extremely
variable. At one time his visage
would be clouded with the gloom of despair,
and at another lighted up with a sort
of horrid exultation; but he spake not,
save to himself.</p>

<p>The friar, therefore, in order to divert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his host, and gratify his own vanity, proposed
to show off some more wonders of
his art. Accordingly he closed up all the
windows once more, making the apartment
as dark as pitch, and exercised many
curious chemical devices, lighted Roman
candles, and made them dance about the
chamber in every colour of the rainbow.</p>

<p>He was still busily employed playing off
his little ingenious tricks, when the party
were disturbed by a bustle in one of the
corners. It chanced to be so dark at the
moment that no one could see what was
going on; but they heard a noise as of two
people struggling; then a blow, and one
falling down with a groan.</p>

<p>The friar paused, calling out and enquiring
what it was. Charlie, never behind in
a fray, bustled over the forms toward the
scene of action; but falling by the way,
the noise was quickly removed to another
corner, a door was opened and shut, and all
was again quiet.</p>

<p>Every one ran about groping his way in
the dark, and coming full drive against
others, till the friar had the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
mind to pull the stuffing out of some of
the windows. The first thing they then
saw was the poet lying on the floor, void
of sense and motion; and then it quickly
appeared that the steward and Delany
were a-wanting. The whole party, save
the Master, set out on the pursuit, headed
by the friar and Charlie, and came just in
time to rescue the maid as the wretch was
dragging her into his abominable cell. It
seemed that he had determined on seizing
her as his prey, and now that the three infernal
pages, his tormentors, were dispatched
elsewhere, he feared neither the Master
nor his guests; and, taking advantage of
the utter darkness, and of the poet and her
being in a corner by themselves, he stole
up to them, gagged the maid, silenced the
poet, who resisted, with one blow, and then
bore off the helpless lady with all expedition.</p>

<p>When he saw that he was overtaken and
overpowered by numbers, he only laughed
at them; and assured them that, in spite of
all they could do, he would have possession
of her, and that they should see. The girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
wept and complained of being hurt; but
then he only laughed and mocked the
louder. Some of them proposed that they
should hew him all to pieces, but the friar
had resolved on his measures, and, at his
request, they took the culprit up before
the Master, and there lodged their accusations
against him. But the Master either
durst not, or would not say a word against
him; for, in fact, it appeared that this great
man, without his familiar spirits, shrunk
into nothing, and was not only afraid of
his own bondsman, but of every thing
around him, deeming himself altogether
without help.</p>

<p>The friar's eye burned with indignation
and rage, at witnessing such arrogance on
the one hand, and imbecility on the other;
but his bootless wrath only delighted the
steward the more; and it was evident that,
had it not been for fear of Charlie Scott's
long sword and heavy hand, he would have
taken his prey from the midst of them.</p>

<p>Delany still wept and sobbed till her
bosom was like to rend, and begged to be
taken away from the castle, or to be killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and put in her grave. The friar tried, with
all the fair and kind speeches he was master
of, to comfort her; but when she saw
the poet pale, bleeding, and sitting still unable
to rise, she only waxed worse, and hid
herself from the eye of the wretch behind
the friar's frock.</p>

<p>"Daughter of my love, and child of many
misfortunes, be thou comforted," said
the friar; "for though the wicked triumph
for a space in their iniquity, yet shall
they not thrive. They who refuse to do
justice to the innocent and upright in heart
shall perish in their sin, and pass away as
the smoke that is driven by the wind.
Therefore, my daughter, be thou comforted;
and that thy heart may be cheered, I
will show thee a wonder of my art,&mdash;a
wonder so great that whosoever seeth it his
heart shall melt within him; and whosoever
heareth of it his ears shall tingle.
Come, whoso listeth, forth into the open
air, and I will do it in the sight of heaven
and of man."</p>

<p>The friar then lifting up his huge portmanteau,
went forth to the large paved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
gateway that surrounded the whole of the
uppermost arches of the castle. It was so
ample as to be like a small field, for it
covered all the castle, save four small
pointed turrets, and the square apartment
which the party now left, that rose like a
shapeless dome above all. In one corner
of this level battlement there stood a leaden
vessel that had once been used as a cistern.
To that the friar went; and, laying down
his huge walise, he took from thence a
handful of blackish sand, and strinkled it
all around the battlement on the one side
to the opposite corner. He then stood
and looked awfully around him. He looked
to the heavens, but they were shrouded
in a dark hideous cloud that now covered
the mountains, and hung lowering over
the uppermost spire of the castle. Neither
the Cope-Law nor the hill of Eildon could
be seen, nor could aught be seen save the
dark and troubled cloud. The scene was
truly impressive; and when the rest saw
the friar looking on it with such apparent
dread, all of them looked abroad with him,
and whispered to one another, "He's gaun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to be about some awesome enchantment
now."</p>

<p>The friar covered up his pormanteau
with the leaden vessel, and then desired
the Master to bring any weight he chose,
and heap it on its bottom, which he had
now turned uppermost, and, at one word
or sign, he would make his goat-skin wallet
carry the vessel, and all such weight,
round the battlements of the castle.</p>

<p>The Master, and every one present, pronounced
the thing to be impossible,&mdash;the
steward grinned in derision,&mdash;and, after
mocking and taunting the friar on his art
in the most gross and provoking terms, he
proffered to hold down the leaden tub, wallet
and altogether, or to forfeit his head if
he failed. Then laying himself over it, in
the attitude of holding it down, he called
on the friar to proceed, and give him the
promised canter round the walls, which
he well deserved, he said, not only for his
kindness to them all, and to their Miss in
particular, but also for his kind intentions.
Then he scoffed aloud, crying out, "Now
thou poor vain fool and liar, be as good as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thy word, and give me, an it were, but one
hobble."</p>

<p>"God do so to me, and more also," said
the friar, "if I do not give thee such a
hobble as eye hath not seen!"</p>

<p>With that he struck a spark of fire
among the black sand, as the rest supposed
it to be, that lay among his feet. The sand
caught fire,&mdash;the flame ran sputtering
around the western battlement,&mdash;and the
next moment the steward and his tub
bolted away into the firmament in a tremendous
flash of fire, and with a sound so
loud that it shook the castle to its foundations.
Some averred that they saw, through
the fire and smoke, a momentary glance
of him and the cistern both, as they pierced
the cloud towards the north; but nothing
further was heard or seen,&mdash;and, in a second
of time, all was quite and gloomy
above and around as it had been before.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind blew as 'twould blawn it's last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thickening showers rose on the blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speedy gleam the darkness swallowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night a child might understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deil had business on his hand!<br /></span>
</div>
<span class="i8"><i>Tam o' Shanter.</i><br /></span>
</div>


<p>Long was it before any of the astonished
spectators opened their lips. The shock
had almost deprived them of sense, sight,
and motion; and when they began to articulate,
it was only to utter short exclamations,
and names of saints. Tam Craik
was the first who ventured a remark, which
was in the following words:&mdash;"By the
Lord Robin!" (meaning, it was supposed,
the king,) "The deil has flown away wi'
him bodily in a flash o' fire!"</p>

<p>The great Master stood mute with astonishment;
he even trembled with dread;
and appeared once as if he would have fallen
at the friar's feet: But he never said,
Where is my seneschal gone? Whither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hast thou sent him? seeming rather to succumb
to his guests for the time, being as a
man utterly at their mercy. His powerful
and malevolent spirits had left him by
his command; his steward, and only human
attendant, had been blown into the
air; and as for the miserable night-hag,
they had seen no more of her since her
escape from the prison vault, and they
wist not whether she remained in the castle,
or had fled from it out of dread of
the symbols of the Christian religion, which
she had seen about the friar, and the effects
of which she had felt in frustrating
her potent spells. The wizard had therefore
none to execute his commands, and
appeared a being quite forlorn, as well as
greatly troubled in his mind.</p>

<p>No one ever knew to this day by what
means the wicked seneschal was borne away
among the clouds in a column of fire
and smoke; and those who witnessed it
spread the word over the country, that the
devil took him away with a great roar amid
fire and brimstone; and that, after
having him up among the dark clouds, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
tore him all to pieces. It was a fact that
one of the steward's mangled limbs was
found hanging on a tree, among some thick
branches, in the wood of Sheil's Heuch,
over against the castle, which gave some
countenance to the report; and no farther
remnants of him were ever discovered.</p>

<p>The friar, however, knew well enough
by what means he was taken away; and
though he never explained it as long as he
remained in Scotland, it is meet that the
readers of this tale should know the truth.
It can be told in a few words. The friar
had brought his huge wallet full of the
strongest gunpowder he had been able to
make, to shew off his wonderful feats, and
astonish the great Master. The exigency of
the moment induced him to part with it all
at once; and, in all probability, he could not
have caused so much astonishment by any
experiment he could have put in practice.</p>

<p>He was guilty, however, of a manifest
oversight; one that had well nigh proved
fatal to the whole party in its consequences,
When they found themselves freed
from their vile persecutor, and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Master rather their prisoner than they his,
their first thought was of departing from
that unhallowed place, and awaiting, in
the neighbourhood, the wizard's final answer,
without which they durst not well
return to the warden.</p>

<p>Charlie jumped on the battlement with
very joy that he would now get down to
the mill to see what was become of Corby,
and how he fared; and he was the first
man to proceed down the narrow stair-case,
leading the way to the fair fields.
But, alas, how transient are all sublunary
joys and hopes! In the middle of this confined
and difficult stair, just at its darkest
and most acute turn, there was a massive
iron door, which Charlie ran his nose against
in his descent, and soon found, to
his mortification and disappointment, that
it was locked and double locked. He returned
to those above with the dismal information.
The friar's countenance fell,
and he became pale as ashes, when it was
thus brought to his recollection that he
had not only blown the brutal seneschal
to the devil, but that he had blown the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
keys of the castle along with him; and
there were they left on the roof to perish
with hunger.</p>

<p>After many ineffectual attempts to
break open that door, having no other resource,
they agreed to go to the topmost
tower, and there unite their voices, in
order to raise the country to their assistance;
for, without ropes and ladders, they
saw no means of escape. Accordingly
they ascended, and uttered many a prolonged
and tremendous shout, for the space
of a whole hour. But these unwonted
cries only drove the hinds to a greater
distance from the castle. Many of them
had witnessed the mighty explosion at
the exit of the seneschal, which, in the
middle of the lurid gloom, had a hideous
effect; and when they heard such long
and loud howls proceeding from the battlements
of that gloomy and desolate pile,
they weened that a whole host of demons
had assembled about it, and kept far aloof.</p>

<p>In these and other fruitless exertions,
our hapless prisoners spent the evening of
that eventful day. The sun, or the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
sky, had not once appeared since the break
of morn. For a little while, about noon,
the hills of the Forest were visible, and,
on their back-ground of pale shadowy
clouds, formed a scene of dark sublimity.
Still, as it approached toward evening,
these clouds came lower and lower down
upon the hills, and became more dark and
dense in their appearance; and precisely
at the close of day the storm burst forth in
all its fury, sweeping over hill and dale
with increasing majesty every minute.
The woods roared and crashed before the
blast. The snow descended so thick that
in a short time every ravine and sheltered
dell was heaped. After that came sleet
and snow mingled; and, finally, a driving
rain dashed with such violence on the
earth, that it seemed as if a thousand cataracts
poured from the western heaven to
mix with the tempest below. Needless
is it to describe that night farther. It
was that on which the great battle was
fought in the camp of Douglas, and formerly
mentioned in this momentous history.&mdash;It
is therefore apparent that Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the curate is now drawing near to the
same period of time when he broke off at
a tangent and left the camp, and that
every thing will, of course, go on to the
catastrophe without further interruption.</p>

<p class="break">Kind hearted and gentle reader, be not
too sanguine. Who can tell what is to
fall out between the cup and the lip?
Incidents seem to have multipled intentionally
to interrupt poor Isaac's narrative.
Besides, let any one consider how he is to
liberate and get free of this group of interesting
individuals, locked up, as they
were, to perish on the top of the castle of
Aikwood. It was no difficulty to Isaac.
He was one of those wise and downright
men who know that truth tells always
the best, and to that maxim he adhered.
But the worst of it was, there were so
many truths, that any body may see it
was scarcely possible to get them all narrated
in their proper places; and that, without
the help of the waggoner, the task
could never have been effected.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gude sauf us, but it is gaun to be an
awsome night!" said Charlie Scott, as he
stepped the last up into the dark apartment
in which the party had spent the
greater part of the day, and into which
the storm had now driven them once more.</p>

<p>"Gaun to be?" said Tam, taking up
Charlie's words; "I wot nae what it is
gaun to be, but it is an awsome night already."</p>

<p>"It brings me in mind of a story," said
Gibbie, "that I hae often heard about
a friar Gabriel o' St Martin's that raised
the deil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Od, Sir, an ye dare, for the blood of
you, speak another word about raising the
deil the night," cried Charlie, interrupting
him, "may I be chased by an Englishman,
if I dinna thraw you ower the castle
wa'. We little ken wha may be near, or
wha may be amang us. Gin ane may judge
by appearances, that same chap ye hae
named (gude keep me frae repeating it)
isna in his ain hett hame the night. Heaven
defend us, hear how the wind howls and
sobs! I wish yon auld houses o' the mill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
may be safe aneuch; they stand sair exposed.
Hech-ho! hear til't! There will
be mony cauld quarters on Otterdale the
night, but there is some a-wanting there
that wad be blithe to share them."</p>

<p>The friar now set himself to strike a
light, which at last he effected; and collecting
the oil which remained in the
lamps into one, they found, to Charlie's
great satisfaction, that they had as much
as would burn over-night, besides some
remnants of waxen torches. Of all the
huge remains of their morning feast that
they had seen removed from the table,
they could not find one vestige, even
though the trenchers remained in the chamber
as it was termed; but, to their great
joy, they found an article as precious to
the eyes, for about two-thirds of the huge
flagon of the wine of Palestine were still
left. This, in the total absence of fuel, was
a discovery of some consequence; and the
friar, in the like absence of a steward, took
that office voluntarily on himself.</p>

<p>When the lamp was kindled, the first
thing that Delany did was to dress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
poor poet's hurt head, and bind it up with
a napkin. This attention and kindness so
thrilled his heart that he could not refrain
from tears, and seemed to rejoice in his
wound; and as both he and his adored
maiden had seen the ruffian steward transported
up to heaven in a flame of fire, they
were freed from all terror on his account;
and, notwithstanding all the perils with
which they were surrounded, they appeared
composed, and, if not happy, were at
least quite resigned to their fate.</p>

<p>The great Master sat muffled up in his
cloak, and apart by himself, his brows
screwed down into deep curved wrinkles,
and his sunken eye fixed on the ground.
The friar filled a cup of wine, and, bowing,
presented it to him the first. He took
the cup, and drank it off, but he spoke
not a word: his piercing eyes glimmered
round the chamber; he uttered a loud
groan, and, apparently, sunk again into
his deep reverie. The transportation of
his steward, while in the very act of braving
the friar's might, made a terrible impression
on his mind, and he weened that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he now sat before his master&mdash;before one
that might send him on a voyage of the
same nature whenever he chose; and therefore
he judged, with great reason, that for
a space it behoved him to keep on good
terms with so dangerous an opponent.</p>

<p>When each had taken a cup of the elevating
beverage, the effect was delightful;
all their cares, dangers, and wants faded;
the terrors of the storm, that was still increasing,
only startled them now and then,
as it rattled on the tower, or yelled thro'
the crevices below. They chatted, laughed,
and broke jokes on each other, till
even the sublime Master was diverted from
his profound and brooding ideas, and smiled
at the rustic simplicity of the characters
around him. The laird of the Peatstacknowe
told a great number of his long stories,
of which something that was seen,
said, or done, always reminded him; Charlie
told confused stories about battles and
forays; and the poet came in always between
with his rythmatic descriptions and
allusions; until at one time the associations
of ideas followed one another in a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
so truly ludicrous, that the enchanter actually
laughed till he had almost fallen into
a fit, a thing that had not for twenty years
been witnessed of him.</p>

<p>The tempest still continued to rage, and
the loquacity of the party beginning to
flag, they became drowsy as midnight approached.
The friar then looking gravely
around him, and, laying aside his hood,
took a small psalter book from his bosom;
which volume also contained the four books
of the Apocalypse; and, opening it reverendly,
he proposed that they should all
join in performing the evening service to
the Virgin, and the hymn to the Redeemer.
Delany rose from off the lap of the
poet's cloak, where she had sat nestling all
the evening, and came and kneeled down
at the friar's knee. The Master started up
with a look of indignation, stamped on the
floor, and ordered the friar to put up his
vain book, and refrain from such flummery
in his presence. The friar looked at
him with a steady countenance.</p>

<p>"It is not meet that I should obey man
rather than God," said he. "I have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a vow in the face of Heaven, and I will
pay that vow in spite of men and devils.
I will sing my holy hymns with these my
friends and children, and he that listeth
not to join, let him be accursed, and translated
from the presence."</p>

<p>This last sentence sounded rather equivocally
in the Master's ears. He liked not
such a translation as he had lately witnessed;
for, with all his power and mysterious
art, the terrors of death still encompassed
him about. He held his peace, therefore,
although he growled like a lion at bay at
being bearded thus in his own castle.</p>

<p>The friar proceeded as he had said, and
all the rest joined him with becoming devotion,
save the poet, whose orisons that
night were somewhat cold. He could not
brook the charm that drew Delany from
his own side to his rival's knee. The Master
sat aloof, biting his lip, and grinning in
derision; but, at one part of the service, although
the curate does not say what part,
he was insensibly overcome, and fell into
a painful oblivious dream. The strains of
the sacred music, simple as they were, stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
over his soul, as some remembrance of early
life sometimes steals into the heart of enfeebled
age, reminding the decaying and
dying worm of joys he can no more see,
and of feelings of delight that have perished
for ever.&mdash;If a son of the mountains of
the north were transported to some far foreign
clime, and there doomed to remain
for life: After sojourning in that land for
half an age, until grey and bowed down,
if by chance, on some still evening, or mayhap
through the eddies of the storm, one
of the strains of his native land were poured
on his ear, think of the recollections it
would awaken in his mind: How painfully
thrilling the sensations! Would it not
be like the last sweet beam of a hope he
was never more to cherish, a last look of all
that was dear on earth?&mdash;Such were the
feelings that crept unbidden over the soul
of the enchanter, on hearing the sweet
sounds, that reminded him of a religion he
had for ever renounced, and in which he
had never firmly believed till he had believed
to tremble.</p>

<p>In this troubled trance he sat leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
against the wall, until the worshippers had
reached the middle of the hymn to the Saviour.
He then was seized with strong
convulsions, and, rising up, with staggering
steps, he fled from the chamber,
crying as he went,&mdash;"Cruel and improvident
things! reptiles! cursed, whining
sycophants! that would send me to my
doom before my time!" He rushed out to
the battlements, and, groping his way
through the storm, took shelter in the narrow
staircase, that he might hear no more
of the sounds that thus troubled and distracted
his soul. What dread had seized
him, or what he had seen or heard, his guests
knew not; but they had scarcely well ended
their hymn, when he rushed again in
among them, with wildered looks, and his
hair standing on end, seeming glad to take
shelter among those from whom he had so
lately fled with abhorrence. No one enquired
the cause, for all were so weary and
overcome with slumber; and every one
then composed himself to sleep in the
manner that best suited his convenience.</p>

<p>The storm continued to rage with un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>abated
violence, and, after they had laid
themselves down, they found that the castle
was all tottering and quaking before it.
The firmest heart was appalled; for the
rocking of the castle was not all; every now
and then they heard eldritch shrieks arising,
as of some wretch perishing, or rather, as
some of them thought, like the voices of
angry spirits yelling through the tempest.
When one of these howling sounds came
on the blast, every one of our prostrate
friends breathed a deep sigh, or uttered
some exclamatory sound, Charlie had always
one, which he uttered even after he
was asleep. "Hech! Gude sauf us, sirs!
what will be the upshot o' a' this?" The
Master sat muffled up in the corner close
behind them, and after he judged them all
to be asleep he fell a-crooning a sort of
hymn in an under key. The poet was,
however, more than half awake, and gathered
up some broken fragments of it.
Poets are never to trust when they give
quotations from memory out of the works
of others; and perhaps honest Carol might
add some bombastic lines of his own, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
he always averred that the following lines
formed a part of the warlock's hymn.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>If it was true that the Master sung these
ridiculous lines, which is not very likely,
his "sovereign and brother" had not accepted
of his sacrifice, nor paid due deference
to his incense of praise. For, a little
before the break of day, our group were
aroused from their profound slumbers by
loud and reiterated cries. The lamp was
still burning feebly and blue. Charlie,
whose ear was well trained to catch any
alarm, was the first to start up; but the
sight that he saw soon laid him again flat
on the floor, though not before he had
leaped clear over a narrow oak-table and
two forms. There was a black being, that
appeared to be half-man and half-beast,
dragging Master Michael Scott along the
room toward the door; yet he dragged him
with difficulty, and at some times the wizard
seemed rather to prevail. Horrible as this
phantom was, all those who saw it agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that there was something about it that
instantly reminded them of the late seneschal;
and, as they raised their heads and
beheld it, every heart was chilled with terror.
Charlie pronounced his short, loud
prayer, which has already been recorded in
this history, and which consisted merely of
one vehement sentence of three syllables;
yea, he pronounced it as he flew; and then
squatting in a corner, and covering his
head with his cloak, that, whatever dreadful
thing happened, he might not see it,
there he lay repeating his little prayer as
fast as human breath could utter it.</p>

<p>The demon struggled hard with the
Master; and the latter, as may well be
supposed, exerted his utmost power,&mdash;so
that his adversary only got him toward the
door as it were by inches. When he found
himself losing ground, he always made a
certain writhing motion, which cannot be
described, and which every time extricated
him somewhat from his adversary's clutches.
Then the apparition laid hold of him again
by the left side with his lobster claws,
and that gripe uniformly caused the wiz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>ard
to utter a loud and piercing cry. At
such times Charlie's little prayer might
be heard waxing still louder as the strife
increased; and, though he lifted not his
face from the earth, he continued a kind
of spurning motion with his feet, as if he
would fain have burrowed under the wall
like a mole.</p>

<p>For a long time no one durst move to
the Master's assistance. The scene so far
surpassed ought they had ever conceived
in horror, that their senses remained altogether
benumbed. The combat continued
with unabated ardour. The Master foamed
at the mouth, his hair stood all on end,
and his bloodshot eyes stared wildly, as if
they would have started from their sockets.
At length the fiend so far prevailed
as to drag the Master close to the door,
where he threw him down, and made a
motion as if he would have dashed him
through below it. But Michael was flesh
and blood, and could not enter nor depart
by the key-hole, or the foot of the door,
like the beings with whom he had to do.
The demon therefore tried to open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
door; but the enchanter's muscular frame
being jammed against it, it could not be
opened at once. Michael's efforts were
now directed to that object alone, namely,
the keeping of the door shut, and he exerted
himself till his remaining strength
was exhausted, but at last suffered himself
to be dragged back from the door,
repeating these words as he lay flat on his
back:&mdash;"'Tis done! 'Tis done! 'Tis over!
'Tis over!"</p>

<p>The lookers on sat and trembled, all
save the friar, who had by that time somewhat
rallied his scattered senses, and stood
on his feet. The fiend had dragged the
Master back from the door by the feet,
and holding him down by the grey hair
with one hand, he opened the door with
the other; then, stooping down, he twisted
the one hand, armed with red crooked
claws, in his hair, and the other in his long
grizzled beard. The friar had stepped forward,
and, at that moment, laying the rood
on the Master's forehead with the one
hand, and the open Book of the Gospels
on his breast with the other, he pronoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>ced
a sacred Name, and in that name commanded
the demon to depart. Swift as
the javelin leaves the hand of the warrior,
or the winged shaft flies from the bowstring,
did the monster fly from the symbols
of a creed by which he and his confederate
powers were all controlled, and
from a name and authority at which the
depths of hell trembled. He rushed out
at the door with a yell of dismay, and
threw himself from the battlement on the
yielding wind. The friar peeped forth after
him, but he only heard a booming
sound, which died on the gale, and beheld
like a dragon of blue livid fire flying toward
the east, in the direction of the hill
of Eildon.</p>

<p>The friar returned into the chamber
with a countenance beaming with joy. No
conqueror ever returned from the field of
battle with an exultation of mind so sublime
as that which now lighted up his uncourtly
mien. His victory had been so
sudden and so complete, that all present
were astounded at the greatness and extent
of his power, and none of his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
doubted that his might was as far above
that of their host as the sun or the stars
are above the earth. They had in this instance
seen it exemplified in a manner not
to be disputed; and there was the Master
himself still sitting on the floor, and gazing
on his deliverer with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Man, may I not thank thee for this?"
said he.</p>

<p>"No," said the friar, "think not of a
poor mortal thing like me, overcome with
sins, faults, and follies: You are freed for
this time; but thank One who is greater
than I."</p>

<p>"True; I am freed for the present," said
the Master; "but it is by a mode, and by
a power, that I dare not, for my existence,
acknowledge or acquiesce in."</p>

<p>When Charlie heard by what was passing
that the devil had been vanquished and
was fled, he called out with a voice that
seemed to come from under ground,&mdash;for
he was so muffled up in his cloak that the
sounds could scarcely be heard,&mdash;"Friar,
steek the door." The good man obeyed,
and as soon as Charlie heard the welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sound, he raised his face, which was much
of the same colour as a living lobster, and,
standing on one knee, viewed all the faces
and corners with that eloquence of eye
which is quite indescribable. How superior
was it to his blunt address:&mdash;"Gude
sauf us, callans, is a' safe?&mdash;Is the coutribat
ower? Sic a fie-gae-to as yon I saw
never! Hech! but it is an unsonsy place
this! I wadna live here an there warna another
place to be had aneath the shoulder
o' heaven."</p>

<p>A long discussion now commenced between
the friar and the Master, on the principles
which each of them professed. That
colloquy is too serious, and too tedious, to
be copied at full length in this place; but
it amounted simply to this,&mdash;That the one
considered the Christian Revelation as the
source of all that is good, wise, or great among
men. The other had disbelieved it
from his youth upward; and, not being
able to come to any conclusion from ought
he could learn among men, he had besought
communion with the potent spirits of the
elements; and, after seven years of unpa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>ralleled
suffering, such as cannot be named,
had attained what he sought. These had
confirmed him in his infidelity. He had
entered into a league with them, renouncing,
for ever and ever, all right in a Redeemer,
and signing the covenant with his
own blood. That afterwards he had rejoiced
in this fellowship, which had enabled
him to do deeds such as no other man could
perform, till by degrees he discovered that
the meanest professor of the religion of Jesus,
if influenced by faith and sincerity,
had the power of counteracting these mighty
spirits, and of frustrating their highest
intents. That then his eyes were opened
when it was too late, and he only believed
in time to tremble and despair. The
friar urged the inexhaustible riches of
heavenly mercy; but the Master spurned
at it, declaring his resolution to abide by
his covenant, whatever his fate might be.
He despised the very name and nature of
repentance, and would rather suffer with
the colleagues he had chosen, he said, than
whine and cringe to another master,&mdash;"Though
I now feel to my sorrow that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
they are subordinate," added he, "yet
are they mighty and powerful, beyond
what thou canst comprehend; and why
may not I be a sharer in their energies in
a future existence as well as in this?"</p>

<p>The friar gazed and trembled when he
heard the wild and erratic ideas of this extraordinary
man; and, ceasing to reason
further with him, he enquired how it came
that some of these mighty associates of his
were his enemies, and seemed but to watch
an opportunity of tearing him in pieces.</p>

<p>"They are jealous of their rights, and
capricious beyond all conception," said he.
"The utmost circumspection is not fit to
keep on fair and equal terms with them.
Even yet I do not know but that this is
to be my last night here. If I have gone
beyond my commission in the orders I
have given, then am I doomed to be their
bond slave for ages: but if I am within
my limited bounds, and the work is effected,
then shall I still be obeyed for a time
and a season. Would that it were morning
that I might know the worst!"</p>

<p>"Scarcely dost thou need to express thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wish again," said the friar; "for, lo, the
day dawneth in the east, and the shadows
flee away before it; the winds have gone
to their chambers to sleep, and the rains
are over and gone. Let us walk forth and
see how the darkness fadeth before the face
of the day, and all that is stirring abroad
on the fair face of the creation."</p>

<p>The Master did not move, for it was yet
but twilight, and nothing could be seen
distinctly; but the friar stepped down to
the battlements, and Charlie, who looked
on him as their only safeguard, followed.
The poet would doubtless have followed
also to have seen the dawn of the morning
after a storm; but, like all the rhyming
race to this day, he was enslaved by the
eyes of a maid, languished in chains, and
could not move but as she moved. Alas
for the poor amorous poet! The others lay
in a sluggish and restless slumber.</p>

<p>The friar and the bold yeoman strode
together along the paved way, and looked
abroad; but they could see only the
clouds whitening in the eastern horizon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
without being able to distinguish wood
from waste, or land from water.</p>

<p>"Let us kneel down and pray, my son,"
said the friar, "even in this quiet place,
where we shall be freed from the interruptions
of the wicked one; for great and manifold
are the dangers that surround us. I
see not what remains for us, but either to
throw ourselves from the walls and perish,
or remain where we are and feed upon one
another."</p>

<p>"It is an awsome eternitive, man," answered
Charlie; "I'm sure an ye think
praying will do ony good, I shall take off
my bonnet and kneel down on my knees,
and hearken weel; but what mair can I
do?"</p>

<p>"You can join with me in spirit, my
son," said the friar, "and pray with your
heart."</p>

<p>"I am sure, gin I but kend the process,
I am very willing," said Charlie. With
that he took off his steel belted bonnet,
and kneeled reverendly beside the friar,
who prayed so fervently and sublimely for
deliverance, that Charlie looked about every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
minute, not only then, but all that morning,
to see by what means they were to
be delivered; for he had no doubt but they
would be set free to a certainty, and that
in a very short time.</p>

<p>When they arose, the first word that the
friar said was the following fervent exclamation&mdash;"Blessed
Virgin! What do I
see?"</p>

<p>Charlie looked all about for some approaching
miracle; he had even some
hopes of seeing a detachment from the warden's
army; but his eye ranged the dusky
fields in vain.</p>

<p>"What a strange world we live in!" rejoined
the friar: "Yea surely there are
things in heaven and in the earth, and in
the waters,&mdash;yea many things, of which
man knoweth nothing! Why art thou
gazing abroad on all nature, my son?
Turn thine eyes toward the east, and tell
me what thou seest."</p>

<p>Charlie did so; and, on the instant, the
two friends were standing fixed in amazement
like two statues. They moved not,
save, now and then, to steal a momentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
glance at each other. The great mountain
of Eildon was actually rent in pieces
from the top to its very foundations, and
piled up in three towering spiral mountains,
as they remain to this day. Only at
that time they were taller, darker, and
more uniform.</p>

<p>It was a scene of wonder not to be understood,
and awfully impressive. The
two rivers flowed down their respective
vallies, and met below the castle like two
branching seas, and every little streamlet
roared and foamed like a river. The hills
had a wan, bleached appearance, many of
the trees of the forest were shivered; and,
towering up against the eastern sky, there
stood the three romantic hills of Eildon,
where before there was but one.</p>

<p>The friar was the first to move from his
trance, stepping away in deep meditation.
Charlie was by this time likewise released
from the spell, and he ran to the door of
the high chamber, calling aloud, "Come
a' out, sirs, come a' out. The like o' this
was never seen sin the warld stood up!"</p>

<p>They came forth accordingly, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
consternation was correspondent to the
extraordinary event. But when the Master
came out, and saw what was done, he
shouted, and leaped on the battlement
like one frantic, boasting, and uttering
words of terrible blasphemy. He looked
on the mountain of Cope-Law, and he
could scarcely believe his eyes when he
beheld it standing in one unskaithed unbroken
cone, as it had done for ages. He
looked again to the three mountains of
Eildon, and his exultation and blasphemous
boasting was redoubled.</p>

<p>"So, all that you and your master can
effect," cried he, "is to throw a little glamour
on the sight,&mdash;is to practise a little deception!
I never weened the monkish art
or profession to consist of more. See what
my sovereign and master can do!"</p>

<p>"Hold there," said the friar. "Who was
it that made these mountains at the first?
Was that deception?"</p>

<p>"It was not thou," said the Master.</p>

<p>"But who was it, then, that sent up
your wicked seneschal into the stormy
clouds in a flame of fire?" added the friar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
"And who was it that saved your life,
but this morning, from a fiend that would
have devoured you? Were these both
deceptions?"</p>

<p>The Master's countenance fell. The
friar said this, because, in their present
perilous situation, he wished to keep a
little awe over the wizard, and likewise to
put a stop to the torrent of blasphemy
that proceeded from his lips.</p>

<p>The morning advanced, the sun arose,
but no assistance, no relief appeared to our
hapless prisoners. They had tasted nothing
for a day and night, save one cup of
wine each, and they had not above as much
more remaining. For all this the Master
was so much elated, that his behaviour
was rather like that of a person frantic
with joy, than that of one shut up among
others to perish of hunger. His companions
in misfortune noted likewise that
he was again disposed to be peremptory
and tyrannical with them, and they dreaded
that his familiars were again at his
command.</p>

<p>The men wrought all the forenoon en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>deavouring
to break up the iron door; but
they neither had mattocks nor room to
work in, and they made no more impression
on it than as many mice would have
done. They were now quite disconsolate;
and, being unable to do aught else, they
puzzled themselves in accounting for the
late steward's motives for having locked
it. They remembered that it was standing
wide open when they brought him up
a prisoner before the Master; and they
likewise remembered of having seen him
step into that stair for a minute or two, immediately
before he began to brave the
friar. Therefore, all that they could guess
was, that it had been locked with some
fatal intent.</p>

<p>The friar, perceiving that their efforts
were vain, entreated them to come in from
the open air, and keep themselves quiet
and cheerful, that they might wear the
longer. He trusted in Heaven, he said,
that they would be delivered, but in the
mean time it was absolutely necessary to
use every precaution; and for that purpose,
he added, if one of them would keep watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
at each of the four windows, lest any passengers
or countrymen should come near,
he would tell them a story, which would
at least have the good effect of keeping
them quiet. The Master was quite delighted
with this proposal; and, taking the
flagon of wine, he proposed that they
should share it among them; but the rest
opposed it, and contented themselves with
half a cup each.</p>

<p>Charlie was most of all cast down. He
had heard a word from the friar that morning
that sunk deep on his heart. It was
something about eating one another! And
not being able to get rid of the thought,
he brought it again overhead. The rest
were all struck dumb; for they perceived
that it was but too apparent it might come
to that. The Master grinned darkly, and
said it was well. But Gibbie said he hoped,
"if things came that length, they wad
draw cuts, that ilka ane might get a fair
chance for his life." The poet begged,
with tears in his eyes, that, out of respect
to the tender sex, they would leave Delany
the last, or at least that, when the lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fell on her they would take him in her
place. To this they all agreed with one
voice: but an extraordinary thought striking
on the Master's mind at that instant,
he made a motion, and proposed to settle
it off hand by a vote.</p>

<p>"This maid, whom you term beautiful,
is mine on one condition," said he; "and
as I can now in a very short time comply
with that condition, I claim her as my
own. I will therefore give her to the man
among you who tells me the best tale.
She shall be his, fully and freely, to do with
her as seemeth him good. And the man
among you who tells the worst shall, if
need require it, be blooded and flayed in
this same chamber for food to his associates."</p>

<p>Charlie's blood ran cold within him at
this proposal. He almost thought he felt
the flaying knife and the teeth of the ravenous
half-famished eaters; and when the
Master called out, "Approve, or not approve?"
Charlie was the first to call out,
"O! Not! not, not!" He was seconded
by Tam Craik, but all the rest voted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the other side; so that they were left in
the minority, and the matter was finally
decided to be precisely as the Master had
proposed. The poet stretched himself, so
eager was he to begin; for his heart yearned
within him to win the beautiful Delany.
Gibbie was also uplifted, and sure of
victory; but Tam and Charlie were both
quite hopeless and cast down.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="blkquot"><p>And I said unto him, Can'st thou tell unto thy servant what is
the meaning of this?</p>

<p class="citation"><i>Esdras.</i></p></div>


<p>The friar having volunteered a tale, the
priority was unanimously awarded to him:
So, after the watches were set and all quiet,
he began the following singular narrative,
without further ceremony:</p>


<h3>The Friar's Tale.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p>1. In the days of the years of my pilgrimage,
it chanced to me that I sojourned
in the great kingdom that is toward the
south.</p>

<p>2. And I passed through the city that
lieth on the river of the hills, unto the
house of Galli the scribe, who was a good
man and a just.</p>

<p>3. And he had one only daughter, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
was unto him as a treasure and an heritage,
for her mother had been led unto her people
before the maid could distinguish between
her right hand and her left.</p>

<p>4. And the maiden was fair to look upon;</p>

<p>5. For her neck was as polished ivory,
and her chin like the ripened peach basking
on a wall that looketh toward the
south.</p>

<p>6. Her lips also were like the honey-comb;
her teeth were rows of pearl, and
her breath was as sweet smelling incense,
and myrrh, and cassia.</p>

<p>7. Her eyes were brighter than the dew
of heaven, and her hair was like the beams
of the moon streaming through the white
clouds that are in the firmament of air.</p>

<p>8. And I loved the maiden exceedingly;
and my heart burned within me; and I
became as a dead man.</p>

<p>9. And I wist not what to do, or what
would become of me; for the vows of the
Lord were on me that I could not wed;
and I said, Woe is me, for I am undone!</p>

<p>10. And I went in unto her, and communed
with her of my great love; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
when she had hearkened to my voice, she
laughed me to scorn.</p>

<p>11. And I said, Why dost thou laugh
me to scorn? Knowest thou not that I
would lay down my life for thee? For I
love thee so much above all things that are
on the earth, that I would even lick the
dust from off thy feet.</p>

<p>12. And she said, What wouldst thou
have me to do?</p>

<p>13. And I looked on my right hand, and
on my left, and I communed with my heart.</p>

<p>14. And I perceived that the maid had
asked aright, for I knew not what I would
have her to do; and lo my countenance
became abashed.</p>

<p>15. And she laughed at me exceedingly;
yea she laughed at my calamity till
the tears streamed from her eyes.</p>

<p>16. I said therefore unto myself that I
would die, and be gathered unto my fathers;
for how could I live to be a scorn
and a derision, and to be burnt up as with
a devouring flame? and I had many
thoughts of unrighteousness dwelling in
me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>17. And she told her father of these
matters; and Galli the scribe was wroth
with me, and said unto me, Why wouldst
thou betray my daughter, the child of my
age, and the hope of my grey hairs?</p>

<p>18. Is it not better for thee to depart
unto thine own country, and to thy kindred,
than commit this great wickedness?</p>

<p>19. And my spirit was grieved within
me; nevertheless I could not depart, for
my heart clove to the maid, and I loved
her as my own soul.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>1. And it came to pass that the army of
the prince of the land encamped in that
place;</p>

<p>2. For he was a great prince, and had
increased his army; and he had captains
over hundreds, and captains over fifties,
and captains over tens.</p>

<p>3. And these were clothed in gorgeous
apparel, in brocade of gold, and in brocade
of silver; and they were vain men, for
they had the plumage of birds upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
heads, and gems of silver, and of gold, and
of precious stones, on their breasts; and
swords girded on their thighs.</p>

<p>4. And the damsel beheld them, and
her heart danced with joy; yea, her
eyes followed them whithersoever they
went.</p>

<p>5. And I was more grieved than ever;
therefore I counselled her, and said all manner
of evil of the men.</p>

<p>6. But she would not hearken to my reproof,
but cast all my counsel behind her
back; and she derided me.</p>

<p>7. And it came to pass, in the process of
time, that one of the captains of fifty came
to her, and spoke kind words unto her,
even great swelling words of vanity.</p>

<p>8. And she hearkened unto him, and
her ears drunk in his burning speeches,
even as the ox drinketh in water; and she
delighted therein; and he looked into her
eye, and behold he saw his own image impressed
in it, as in a glass.</p>

<p>9. And he looked into it many times,
and it grew brighter; and every time that
he looked into it he saw his own image the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
more deeply and strongly reflected, until
he knew that he lived in her heart.</p>

<p>10. But her image was not in his eye.</p>

<p>11. And I knew this, and was grieved.
Therefore I withstood him to his face, and
rebuked him; yea, and I also cursed him.</p>

<p>12. But the captain of fifty mocked me;
he also told the maid, and she became wroth
with me, so that, the two being combined
against me, I could do nothing but sit
down and weep.</p>

<p>13. And she gave unto him all that she
had; yea she gave him until she had no
more to give, for she gave unto him herself.</p>

<p>14. And her countenance was changed;
her bright eyes retained not their wonted
brightness; her voice was broken, and her
tongue faltered in her mouth.</p>

<p>15. But the captain of fifty regarded it
not; for he left her and went his way, and
he did eat and drink, and made himself
merry with wine.</p>

<p>16. And he said, What is a maiden that
I should regard her? or for what were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
daughters of women formed but for my
pleasure?</p>

<p>17. And the prince of the kingdoms of
the land sent unto his army, that they
should go into a far country to fight against
the enemies of their lord the king. And
the men purposed to go; and the captain
of fifty purposed to go also.</p>

<p>18. And when the maiden heard of it
her heart failed within her, and she fell
sick, and I feared it would be to death.</p>

<p>19. And I tried to comfort her; and I
watched with her day and night, and prayed
many prayers for her; but she became
worse, for her spirit was wounded and cast
down.</p>

<p>20. And Galli the scribe was also sorely
afflicted, and he mourned exceedingly, saying,
Alas! what shall I do for my daughter!
she who was the hope of my age, and
my only comfort here below. Wo is me,
for she is dying of a lingering disease, and
I shall be left childless! Now Galli the
scribe knew not what the captain of fifty
had done unto her, nor of all that she had
given unto him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>21. So I went forth unto the host to seek
this betrayer of women, and to speak
peaceably with him, and to reason with him.</p>

<p>22. But he knew me afar off, and said
to his brethren, Lo, here cometh that man
of a strange country, let us make him our
sport.</p>

<p>23. And they combined against me, and
treated me with great indignity; for they
bound my hands and put me into the river,
and the flood carried me away, so that I
said in mine heart, lo, I shall be drowned,
for there is not one to pity or save me.</p>

<p>24. But they took me forth before my
breath departed clean away; and they
stripped me naked, and tied me to a stake,
and scourged me.</p>

<p>25. And afterwards they stoned me out
of the camp.</p>

<p>26. And I was very wroth, and went
unto the captain of the host, and made my
complaint known unto him.</p>

<p>27. And I said, O my lord, hearken unto
the voice of thy servant. Behold one of
your captains of fifty came unto the house
of Galli the scribe.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>28. And the man intreated him kindly,
yet hath he betrayed his daughter, and
refuseth to do her justice; and the maid
will die, and her father, who is a good man,
will go down to the grave with her.</p>

<p>29. And he answered and said unto me,
What have I to do with this matter, or
with thee? As a maid treadeth the wine
press, so let her drink. It is not meet that
I should be troubled with these things.</p>

<p>30. And I went away and wept bitterly,
for I could find neither consolation nor redress;
and I saw that the wickedness of
the men was very great.</p>

<p>31. Then I went and trimmed my beard,
and borrowed me a suit of armour; and I
put an helmet of steel upon mine head,
and a breast-plate upon my breast, and I
girded on a sword.</p>

<p>32. And I went forth and challenged the
captain of fifty to fight with me.</p>

<p>33. And I said in mine heart, Lo, I will
fight this wicked man, and overcome him.
And I will take his sword from him, and
rend his armour from off his loins.</p>

<p>34. And then will I compel him to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
justice to those whom he hath wronged,
else will I smite off his head.</p>

<p>35. And we met by the side of the river;
and he discerned me not through my disguise,
for he said unto me, Who art thou,
or what have I to say to thee?</p>

<p>36. And I said, For the wrong that thou
hast done to the house of Galli the scribe
have I called thee out to battle.</p>

<p>37. And he said, Thou hast done well.
I will chastise thee as thou deservest, that
thou mayest learn how to lift up thy hand
against the servants of our lord the king.</p>

<p>38. So we fought; and his hand was sore
against me.</p>

<p>39. For he drove me out of my place,
and wounded me, and my hope had nearly
perished.</p>

<p>40. But I prayed to the Lord for strength.
And we fought again; and the combat was
very sore that day, and he prevailed not
against me.</p>

<p>41. And after the combat had lasted until
my breath was spent, and my arm weary,
by the help of the Lord I wounded him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the loins, so that my sword found a passage
through his body, and he fell.</p>

<p>42. And I was sore afraid; and fled
away, and hid myself; for I trembled at
the thing I had done, because I perceived
that the last case was worse than the first.</p>

<p>43. And when the soldiers came to him,
he said that Galli the scribe had sent out
ruffians to slay him.</p>

<p>44. And when these things were told to
the captain of the host, he was exceedingly
wroth, and he sent forth men to destroy
the house of Galli the scribe, and to slay
him, and take his substance for a prey.</p>

<p>45. And the captain of fifty died that
night; and they buried him with great lamentation,
for they wept over him, saying,
Alas! our brother! for he hath been cut
off before his time.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>1. And it came to pass, that after I had
laid aside my armour, and put on my pilgrim
weeds, that I went forth into the
plain, and into the city.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>2. And when I heard the words of the
captain of the host, and the command that
he had given, I hasted to the house of Galli
the scribe, and said unto him, Go to, put
up all thy money, and thy jewels, and fly
for thy life, for behold evil is determined
concerning thee.</p>

<p>3. But he would not hearken to my
voice; for he said, I have done no man
wrong.</p>

<p>4. And I intreated him, but prevailed
not.</p>

<p>5. Therefore I went unto his daughter,
and told her of what I had heard; and I
said, Rise up, make haste and escape, for
the soldiers will abuse thee.</p>

<p>6. And she was afraid, and said unto me,
Take me, and hide me for a short time, for
thy words have never deceived me.</p>

<p>7. And I hid her in a palm tree, and remained
with her.</p>

<p>8. And the men who belonged to the
captain of fifty, even to him whom I slew
in battle, came as they were commanded;
and they entered into the possessions of
Galli the scribe, and they took all that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
had for a prey, and burned his house with
fire.</p>

<p>9. And we beheld all from our hiding-place,
and were greatly astonished; for we
saw Galli the scribe flying through the garden,
and the soldiers pursuing hard after
him, with their swords drawn.</p>

<p>10. And when his daughter saw it she
shrieked and fainted away; and when the
men heard her voice they looked about,
and some of them ran into the arbour, but
they found her not, therefore they pursued
after Galli the scribe.</p>

<p>11. And I trembled sore, for I knew
not if we were discovered, neither could I
support the maiden in her seat.</p>

<p>12. For she beheld whose men they were
that pursued after her father to slay him,
and she deemed that her captain of fifty
had sent out his fifty to devour them, yea
to destroy, and to slay, and to ravage; and
there was no more spirit in her.</p>

<p>13. And I prayed to the Lord my God
out from among the branches of the palm
tree, and he heard my voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>14. For the spoilers came, and they
sought, but they found us not.</p>

<p>15. For their eyes were blinded that
they could not see. We beheld their eyes,
and heard the threatenings that proceeded
out of their mouths, yet could they not
perceive us.</p>

<p>16. And their threatenings were filled
with the abominations of iniquity, for the
men were very wicked.</p>

<p>17. And I took her out of the palm tree
by night; and I covered her with my sack-cloth
gown, and we tried to fly and make
our escape, but she could not; therefore my
distress was very great.</p>

<p>18. And I carried her to the house of a
poor widow in the suburbs of the city, and
I concealed her there till her strength
should recover.</p>

<p>19. And I went about making many
inquiries; and I heard that the soldiers had
taken Galli the scribe, and had given him
up to be persecuted, and tormented, and
slain; also that the whole army were
abroad searching to recover his daughter,
to execute vengeance on her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>20. And I was grieved for that I had
done, and for bringing evil on those I
loved; for I knew that the men of the host
spoiled the people, and did according to
their will.</p>

<p>22. So I borrowed me a pilgrim's robes,
and in these I equipped the maiden; and
when she was clothed in her flowing sack-cloth
gown, with her cross, scallop, and
shell, behold I myself could not discern her.</p>

<p>22. And we escaped from the city by
night, and journeyed toward the north,
and at break of day we came to the fords
of the great river, where we were encountered
by three of the soldiers of the guard,
who waylaid us.</p>

<p>23. And I said unto them, Whom seek
ye? And they said, We be sent out to
seek the daughter of Galli the scribe, for
she hath betrayed one of the captains into
her nets, and hath robbed him, and also
caused him to be cut off from his men;
therefore are we sent out to take her, that
she may be delivered into the hands of his
men, that they may do to her as seemeth
good in their eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>24. And the maiden trembled, so that
the men beheld it; and I turned and said
unto her, Said I not that it was so?</p>

<p>25. And I said furthermore, Sit thee
down, my brother, until we converse with
these men, for they are good men, and
filled with wisdom; and lo, have not I
strange things to relate unto them?</p>

<p>26. And the men sat down, and we sat
down beside them.</p>

<p>27. And I said, We are pilgrims and
strangers, and come from a far country.
And they said, Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>28. And I said, moreover, that it was
given unto me to dream dreams, and to
see visions, and that I had a vision of my
head upon my bed, which was of this Galli
the scribe of whom they spake.</p>

<p>29. For I saw and beheld that he had
put forth his hand on a captain of the servants
of my lord the king, and had sent
forth his bravadoes, who had wounded him
until the sword passed through him, even
from the left side unto the right. And
the men said, Is not this wonderful?</p>

<p>30. And behold I saw the servants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
my lord the king enter the dwelling of the
man, even of the scribe, and take his goods,
and him they pursued with the edge of the
sword, and took by the vineyard as thou
goest down towards a river.</p>

<p>31. And they burned his house with
fire, so that the flames ascended up on high;
and his daughter who was sick, and concealed
in an inner chamber, her also did
they burn until she was quite consumed.</p>

<p>32. And the men wondered exceedingly;
and they bowed down their heads and
said, Thou hast told unto us strange things.
It is even as thou hast said. Go on your
way.</p>

<p>33. And I blessed them; and they returned
to tell unto their captains the wonderful
things which they had heard.</p>

<p>34. And I fled with the damsel until I
came to the sea; and when we had found
a ship we went into it, and I brought her
to my own country, but not to my kindred,
for I placed her in the holy isle near
the river of the north.</p>

<p>35. And she mourned night and day for
her father, and also for the captain of fifty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
whom she called her husband; for she
dreaded that some evil had befallen unto
him.</p>

<p>36. For, on the day that he had sworn to
her, he had given her a graven image,
which she kept hid in her bosom, and she
wept over it and kissed it.</p>

<p>37. And I was grieved, and rebuked her,
but she refused to be comforted; and I
went and came and brought her of the
good things of the land, for I loved her as
the breath of my nostrils.</p>

<p>38. And when the days of her months
were fulfilled, behold she brought forth a
daughter.</p>

<p>39. And the babe was also beautiful to
look upon. And the bosom of the mother
yearned over her child, and she called her
by her father's name, even by the name of
the captain of fifty.</p>

<p>40. And she kissed her child, and wept
over it day and night; but the frame and
substance of her body were wasted away
with perpetual grief, and I saw that the
child would die.</p>

<p>41. And, when I saw the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that was once beautiful as the morning
bathed in tears, as her babe lay at a breast
in which there was no nourishment, I was
exceedingly sorry even unto death.</p>

<p>42. And lo, I took the child and nourished
it; yea I fed it with bread and with
wine, with butter also, and with honey
and milk from the beasts of the field; and
the child was restored.</p>

<p>43. But the mother decayed like a flower
that is cut down; for the winds of grief
had passed over her, and her spirit was consumed.
The summer came, and all the
herbs of the field were renewed, but the
fairest flower of the land was bending down
to meet the clay.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>


<p>1. And it came also to pass that as soon
as I found myself in a land of safety, I
wrote many letters to Galli the scribe; for
I said, Peradventure he may escape out
of their hands.</p>

<p>2. I wrote also to the chief of our order,
giving account of the whole matter, and
attesting the innocence of Galli the scribe.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>3. But no answer came to me, therefore
was I sore distressed; for I said, If the mother
and babe both perish, what shall become
of me?</p>

<p>4. And one day as I sat with the babe
on my knee, I beheld, and, lo, the eyes of
the mother were fixed mournfully on her
babe, and she lifted them to my face, and
looked at her babe again.</p>

<p>5. And I could not contain myself; so I
lifted up my voice and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>6. But she smiled, and said, Wherefore
shouldst thou weep? Behold, am not I in
the hand of the Lord? And my child, the
daughter of my youth, and of my love,
thou also art in the hands of thy Maker.</p>

<p>7. May he lead thee, and guide thee,
and keep thee from the snares in which
thy mother hath fallen.</p>

<p>8. Though thou hast lost thy father, as
I also have lost mine, yet hast thou a Father
in Heaven who will not forsake thee.
Neither shalt thou altogether lack a father's
care here below.</p>

<p>9. And she said to me, Is it not even so?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>10. And I could not answer her, for I
wept aloud; yea, I even wept until the
child grew affrighted, and wept also.</p>

<p>11. And the mother took the graven
image from her neck, and from her bosom;
and she kissed it, and hung it round the
neck of her babe.</p>

<p>12. And she said, It is the image and
likeness of thy father, wear it, my child,
till the day of thy death.</p>

<p>13. Peradventure thou mayest fall among
his people, and among his kindred, for they
were men of honour and renown.</p>

<p>14. And she kissed her child, and said,
Now shall I be taken from thee, and go to
my grave, and they will bury me, my babe,
among strangers, and there is none of my
people to shed a tear over me.</p>

<p>15. And we all wept abundantly, and
shed many tears.</p>

<p>16. And while we yet cried aloud, lifting
up our voices, behold one entered in,
and said, Peace be with you!</p>

<p>17. And I discerned him not, for mine
eyes flowed like two fountains of water.</p>

<p>18. But the woman cried out, and sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
from her couch, and she clasped her arms
around his neck, and said, My father! my
father!</p>

<p>19. And behold it was Galli the scribe.</p>

<p>20. And the woman said, Now hath my
child found a father indeed.</p>

<p>21. And she said, Blessed and happy
mayest thou be, my daughter, for I bring
thee joyful tidings, and blessed be this man
who hath befriended and saved thee. His
intercession hath also saved the life of thy
father; all that was mine hath been restored
to me, yea, and more also.</p>

<p>22. And I will give all unto thee and to
thy child after thee, and thou shalt have
riches and honours in thy own country,
and among thy own people.</p>

<p>23. But his daughter answered him not,
for the words died on her tongue; but she
looked in his face and smiled, and then she
looked at her babe as it lay on my knee.</p>

<p>24. And Galli the scribe was sore amazed,
and said, What aileth thee, my daughter?
and why answerest thou not to the
words of thy father?</p>

<p>25. And he held her in his arms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
her hands were clasped around his neck
that they would not be loosed.</p>

<p>26. And behold there was a sound like
a small voice issued from her mouth, and
the light of her eyes became dim, and her
head fell back over the arm of her father.</p>

<p>27. And her gentle spirit departed away
unto him that gave it; for she spoke no
more, neither breathed she any more.</p>

<p>28. And we buried her in the isle of the
holy place, and mourned for her many
days.</p>

<p>29. And I besought of Galli the scribe
that he would leave the child with me,
that I might bring her up in our convent,
and breed her in the ways of purity and
truth.</p>

<p>30. But he refused, and said, I cannot
part with the child of my only daughter;
she shall go with me and be the heiress of
all that I possess.</p>

<p>31. And after I had blessed him, he departed
with the little maid to go to his
own land, and I saw them no more.</p>

<p>32. For after many years had elapsed,
I went again into the country beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
river, and I visited the house of Galli the
scribe.</p>

<p>33. But behold he had never returned
to that place; and the people of the land
reported unto me, that he fell among
thieves, and was slain, and the babe was
slain with him, or led into captivity.</p>

<p>34. The ways of heaven are unsearchable,
and the hand of man often worketh
out its decrees. But for the misfortunes
that befel the house of Galli the scribe
will I go mourning till the day of my
death.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has made my heart very sair that
tale," said Charlie; "I wish you hadna
tauld it."</p>

<p>"I think it is nae tale ata'," said Tam
Craik: "If I coudna hae tauld a better tale
than that, I wad never hae begun. I could
now wager sax merks, and sax brass mowdiworts
to boot, that the Gospel-friar is
the man that shall be the first to thole the
knife. And what for should he no? He'll
make the best mart amang us."</p>

<p>"I differ widely from you," said the
poet, "with regard to the merits of the
tale. I love the friar for telling it; and I
love him ten times better for the part he
took in the transaction. How I do admire
the love that has no selfish flaw, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
moiety of sense to prompt its aberrations!
Should I ever get free from this vile pinnacle,&mdash;this
grave in altitude,&mdash;I'll search
the world for that dear child, and find her
too, if in the world she be."</p>

<p>"Alas! I have searched, and searched
in vain," answered the friar. "It was so
long before I knew of the mishap of my
friend, and my darling child, that all memory
of the transaction was lost. I would
travel from sea to sea, and from the river
to the ends of the earth, to find out that
dear, that beloved maiden; and could I
find her I would yet put her in possession
of the inheritance of her father. For I have
instructed the heads of our order, and they
are preserving it in their own hands as the
patrimony of the orphan and the father-less."</p>

<p>During the time of the friar's narrative,
Delany had been sitting close by his knee
in fixed and earnest attention; and at this
time there chancing to be a pause in the
conversation, she looked wistfully about,
as if afraid she was going to commit herself
by telling a lie. But there was such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
beam of intelligence playing over her lovely
countenance, that all the party fixed
their eyes on her, as if watching with the
deepest interest what she was going to say.</p>

<p>"I have a confused dream of having
heard something of this story before," said
she: "but subsequent events had quite
obliterated the traces of it from my memory,
till this narrative renewed them: I
think I can give you some intelligence of
this lost maiden. You said she was called
by her father's name. Do you recollect
what that father of her's was called?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that will I never forget while memory
retains her seat in this repentant bosom,"
said the friar. "His name was Captain
Jacques De-la-Veny."</p>

<p>"The very same," said the maid. "Then
do you know ought of this? Or did you
ever see it before?"&mdash;and she took a small
miniature from her bosom, holding it near
to the friar's eye.</p>

<p>"By the blessed stars of heaven, and the
Holy Virgin that rules above them!" exclaimed
the friar; "it is the graven image
of the captain of fifty whom I slew in bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>tle.
I saw it placed in thy bosom, yea I
held thee on my knee till that chain of gold
was locked about thy neck never to be removed.
Thou art indeed the daughter of
the fairest and the comeliest among women,&mdash;of
her whom I loved far above my
own life, and for whom I travailled in
pain; yea, thou art the child that I nursed
and held on my knee, and all the inheritance
of thy fathers is thine. Blessed be
thou, my daughter! and blessed be they
who have preserved thee! Come to my bosom
my child, my beloved, my fair one,
that I may fall on thy neck, and bless
thee, and weep over thee; for my soul rejoiceth
that I have found thee."</p>

<p>The poet could stand it no longer; he
threw himself at the maiden's feet, and embraced
them, and wept aloud. Charlie was
busied in drawing pictures of swords and
cross-bows on the floor with the brazen
end of his sheathe, and always giving a
loud sob as if his heart would burst. Even
Master Michael Scott once drew the back
of his hand across his eyes, though no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
believed it was ought of sympathy that affected
him.</p>

<p>"The abbreviation of the name was so
natural in the mouths of the people of this
land," said the friar, "that I wonder I
should never have recognised it, nor yet
on the face of my dear child the features
of her mother. Hard has been thy lot, and
the lot of thy fathers, but blessings may yet
remain in store for thee."</p>

<p>"I dinna see where they're to come frae,"
said Charlie, sighing louder than ever. "It
wad be the hardest thing I ever kend, if
ane sae young, sae bonnie, and sae good,
after a' that she has borne, should be prickit
up atween the yird and the heaven here, to
be hungered to dead, and then eaten wi'
the corbies."</p>

<p>"Life's sweet to us a'," said Gibbie:
"She wad be as little missed as ony that's
here, if she <i>should</i> be starved to death wi'
hunger."</p>

<p>"She shall <i>not</i> be starved to death wi'
hunger;" cried Charlie, in a tone of valiant
desperation. "Na, na; afore she die o'
hunger after a' she has come through, I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
rather cut a limb off my ain body and feed
her wi't. An Corbie be spared, I can e'en
ride by the warden's side wi' a timmer
ane."</p>

<p>"God bless you, for a kind heart," cried
the poet.</p>

<p>"Gin I thought I were to win her mysel,"
said Tam, "and win away wi' life
out o' this luckless place, I wad do a good
deal for her; but if I trowed ony o' you
were to get her frae me&mdash;I'll no tell you
how I feel."</p>

<p>"Just as a hungry man should feel,"
said Gibbie; "and as ane wha has starvation
afore his een maun feel. It is e'en a
sair trial, and often brings me a-mind o' the
story of Marion Gib's callant."</p>

<p>Master Michael Scott, thinking that, in
right of seniority, the Laird was now about
to begin his trial story for life or death,
made a signal with his hand for his guests
to compose themselves, which they did
with one consent; while Gibbie, pleased
with the mark of deference shown to him,
went on:&mdash;

<h3>Laird of Peatstacknowe's Tale.</h3>

<p>There wad aiblins nane o' you ken Marion.
She lived i' the Dod-Shiel; and had
a callant to the lang piper, him that Squire
Ridley's man beat at the Peel-hill meeting.
Weel, you see, he was a gilliegaupy of a
callant, gayan like the dad o' him; for Marion
said he wad hae eaten a horse ahint
the saddle; and as her shieling wasna unco
weel stored o' meat, she had ill getting
him mainteened; till at the lang and the
last it just came to this pass, that whenever
Jock was i' the house, it was a constant
battle atween Marion and him. Jock
fought to be at meat, and Marion to keep
him frae it, and mony hard clouts and claws
there past. They wad hae foughten about
a haggis, or a new kirning o' butter, for a
hale hour, and the battle generally endit
in Jock's getting a', or a good shareo' ilka
thing. (I wish we had sic things here,
even though we had to fight for them!)
When he had fairly gained the possession,
by whatever means, he feasted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
greatest satisfaction, licking his large ruddy
lips, and looking all about him with eyes
of the utmost benevolence. Marion railed
all the while that the poor lad was enjoying
himself, without any mercy and restraint,
and there wasna a vile name under
the sun that had ony signification of a glutton
in it, that she didna ca' him by. Jock
took the bite wi' the buffet;&mdash;he heard a'
the ill names, and munched away. Oh,
how his heart did rejoice o'er a fat lunch o'
beef, a good haggis, or even a cog o' milk
brose! Poor fellow! such things were his
joy and delight. So he snapped them up,
and in two or three hours after he was as
ready for another battle as ever.</p>

<p>This was a terrible life to lead. Times
grew aye the langer the waur; and Marion
was obliged to hire poor Jock to
Goodman Niddery, to herd his kye and his
pet sheep. Jock had nae thoughts at a' o'
ganging to sic a job at first; but Marion
tauld him ilka day o' the fat beef, the huge
kebbucks, and the parridge sae thick that
a horn-spoon wadna delve into them, till
he grew impatient for the term day. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
day came at length, and Marion went away
hame wi' her son to introduce him. The road
was gayan lang, and Jock's crappin began
to craw. He speered a hunder times about
the meat at Goodman Niddery's house,
and every answer that Marion gae was
better than the last, till Jock believed he
was gaun home to a continual feast. It
was a delightful thought, for the craving
appetite within him was come to a great
height. They reached the place, and went
into the kitchen. Jock's een were instantly
on the look-out; but they didna need
to range far. Above the fire there hung
two sides of bacon more than three inches
deep of fat, besides many other meaner
objects: The hind legs of bullocks, sheep,
and deer, were also there; but these were
withered, black, and sapless in appearance.
Jock thought the very substance
was dried out o' them. But the bacon!
How it did make Jock smack his lips! It
was so juicy that even the brown bristly
skin on the outside of it was all standing
thick o' eenbright beaming drops like
morning dew. Jock was established at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Goodman Niddery's; he would not have
flitted again and left these two sides of bacon
hanging there for an estate. Marion
perceived well where the sum of his desires
was fixed, and trembled for fear of an
instant attack: Well might she; for Jock
had a large dirk or sheathed knife (a very
useful weapon) that he wore, and that he
took twice out of its place, looked at its
edge, and then at the enormous bacon ham,
which was more than three inches deep of
solid fat, with the rich drops of juice standing
upon the skin. Jock drew his knife
on his sandal, then on the edge of a wooden
table that stood beside him, examined
the weapon's edge again, and again fixed
his green eyes on the bacon. "What do
the people mean," thought he to himself,
"that they do not instantly slice down a
portion of that glorious meat, and fry it on
the coals? Would they but give me orders
to do it,&mdash;would they even give me
the least hint, how slashingly I would
obey!"</p>

<p>None of them had the good sense to give
Jock ony sic orders. He was two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
times on the very point of helping himself,
and at last got up on his feet, it was
believed, for the sole purpose of making an
attack on the bacon ham, when, behold, in
came Goodman Niddery.</p>

<p>"There's your master, sirrah!" whispered
Marion, "haste ye and whup aff your
bonnet."</p>

<p>Jock looked at him. There was something
very severe and forbidding in his
countenance; so Jock's courage failed him,
and he even took aff his bonnet, and sat
down with that in his one hand and the
drawn knife in the other. Marion's heart
was greatly relieved, and she now ventured
on a little conversation:</p>

<p>"I hae brought you hame my lad, Goodman,
and I hope he'll be a good servant to
you."</p>

<p>"I coudna say, Marion: Gin he be as
gude as you ca'ed him, he'll do. I think
he looks like ane that winna be behind at
his bicker."</p>

<p>"Ay, weel I wat, Goodman, and that's
true; and I wadna wish it were otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Slaw at the meat, slaw at the wark, ye
ken."</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> a good hint o' my mother's!"
thinks Jock to himsel: "What though I
should show the auld niggard a sample?
The folk o' this house surely hae nae common
sense."</p>

<p>The dinner was now, however, set down
on the kitchen-table. The goodman sat
at the head, the servants in a row on each
side, and Jock and his mother at the foot.
The goodwife stood behind her servants,
and gave all their portions. The dinner
that day consisted of broad bannocks, as
hard as horn, a pail of thin sour milk, called
whig, and a portion of a large kebbuck
positively as dry as wood. Jock was exceedingly
dissatisfied, and could not but
admire the utter stupidity of the people,
and their total want of all proper distinction.
He thought it wonderful that rational
creatures should not know what was
good for them. He munched, and munched,
and gnawed at the hard bread and
cheese, till his jaws were sore; but he never
once looked at the food before him; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
leaning his cheek on his hand to rest his
wearied grinders somewhat at every bite
he took, and every splash of the sour shilpy
milk that he lapped in, he lifted his
eyes to the fat bacon ham with the juice
standing on it in clear bells.</p>

<p>Marion wished herself fairly out of the
house, for she perceived there would be an
outbreak; and to prepare the good people
for whatever might happen, she said before
going away,&mdash;"Now, goodwife, my callant's
banes are green, and he's a fast growing
twig; I want to ken if he will get
plenty o' meat here."</p>

<p>"I winna answer for that, Marion;&mdash;he
shall fare as the lave fare; but he's may-be
no very easily served. There are some
misleared servants wha think they never
get enough."</p>

<p>"Tell me this thing, then, goodwife;
will he see enough?"</p>

<p>"Ay; I shall answer for that part o't."</p>

<p>"Then I shall answer for the rest, goodwife."</p>

<p>Jock had by this time given up contending
with the timber cheese, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
blue sour milk, and, taking a lug of a bannock
in his hand, the size of a shoe sole,
he went away and sat down at the fire-side,
where he had a full view of the bacon
ham, three inches thick of fat, with
the dew standing on its brown skin.</p>

<p>The withered bread swallowed rather
the better of this delicious sight; so Jock
chewed and looked, and looked and chewed,
till his mother entered into the security
mentioned. "That is a capital hint,"
thought Jock; "I shall verify my good
mother's cautionry, for I can stand this
nae langer." He sprang up on a seat,
sliced off a large flitch of bacon, and had
it on the coals before one had time to pronounce
a word; and then turning his back
to it, and his face to the company, he stood
with his drawn dirk quite determined to
defend his prey.</p>

<p>The goodwife spoke first up. "Gudeness
have a care o' us! see to the menseless
tike!" cried she; "I declare the creature
has na the breeding o' a whalp!"</p>

<p>Jock was well used to such kind of epithets;
so he bore this and some more with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the utmost suavity, still, however, keeping
his ground.</p>

<p>Goodman Niddery grinned, and his hands
shook with anger, as if struck with a palsy;
but for some reason or other he did not
interfere. The servants were like to burst
with laughter; and Jock kept the goodwife
at bay with his drawn knife, till his
slice was roasted; and then, laying it flat
on his dry piece of bread, he walked out to
the field to enjoy it more at leisure. Marion
went away home; and the goodman
and goodwife both determined to be revenged
on Jock, and to make him pay dear
for his audacity.</p>

<p>Jock gave several long looks after Marion
as she vanished on Kettlemoor, but
he had left no kind of meat in her shieling
when he came away, else it was likely he
would have followed his mother home
again. He was still smacking his lips after
his rich repast, and he had seen too
much good stuff about the house of his new
master to leave it at once; so he was even
fain to bid Marion good-b'ye in his heart,
wipe the filial tear from his eye, poor man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and try to reconcile himself to his new situation.</p>

<p>"Do you carry aye that lang gully
knife about wi' you, master cow-herd, or
how do they ca' ye?" said his master, when
they next met after the adventure of the
bacon.</p>

<p>"I hae aye carried it yet," said Jock,
with great innocence; "and a gay gude
whittle it is."</p>

<p>"Ye maun gie that up," said Niddery;
"we dinna suffer chaps like you to carry
sic weapons about our house."</p>

<p>Jock fixed his green eyes on his master's
face. He could hardly believe him to be
serious; still there was something in his
look he did not like; so he put his knife
deeper into his pocket, drew one step back,
and, putting his under row of teeth in front
of those above, waited the issue of such an
unreasonable demand.</p>

<p>"Come, come; give it up I say. Give
it to me; I'll dispose of it for you."</p>

<p>"I'll see you at the bottom o' the place
my mother speaks about whiles," thought
Jock to himself, afore I gi'e my gully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
either to you or ony that belangs to you."
He still kept his former position, however,
and the same kind of look at his master's
face, only his een grew rather greener.</p>

<p>"Won't you give it up, you stubborn
thief? Then I will take it, and give you a
good drubbing into the bargain."</p>

<p>When Jock heard this, he pulled out his
knife. "That is a good lad to do as you
are bidden," said his master. But Jock,
instead of delivering up his knife, drew it
from the sheathe, which he returned to his
pocket. "Now I sal only say this," said
he; "the first man that tries to take my
ain knife frae me&mdash;he may do it&mdash;but he
shall get the length o't in his monyplies
first." So saying, he drew back his hand
with a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>Goodman Niddery gave such a start that
he actually leaped off the ground, and holding
up both his hands, exclaimed, "What
a savage we have got here! what a satan!"
And without speaking another word he ran
away to the house, and left Jock standing
with his drawn knife in his hand.</p>

<p>The goodman's stomach burned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
revenge against Jock; so that night he
sent him supperless to bed, out of requital
for the affair of the fat bacon; and next day
the poor boy was set down to a very scanty
breakfast, which was not fair. His eye
turning invariably to one delicious object,
the goodman perceived well what was
passing in his heart; and, on some pretence,
first sent away all the servants and
then the goodwife. He next rose up himself,
with his staff in his hand, and, going
slowly away into the little parlour, said,
as he went through the kitchen, "What
can be become o' a' the fo'k?" and with
that entered the dark door that opened in
a corner. He made as though he had shut
the door, but he turned about within it
and peeped back.</p>

<p>The moment that he vanished was the
watch-word for Jock; he sprang from his
seat at the bottom of the table, and, mounting
a form, began to whang away at the
bacon ham. Some invidious bone, or hard
object of some sort, coming unfortunately
in contact with the edge of his knife,
his progress was greatly obstructed; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
though he cut and sawed with all his
might, before he succeeded in separating
a piece of about two pounds weight from
the main body, his master had rushed on
him from his concealment, and, by one
blow of his staff, laid him flat on the floor.
The stroke was a sore one, for it was given
with extreme good will, and deprived Jock
of sensibility for the time being. He and
his form both came down with a great
rumble, but the knife remained buried in
the fat bacon ham; and the inveterate
goodman was not satisfied with felling the
poor lad, but kicked him, and laid on him
with his stick after he was down. The
goodwife at length came running, and put
a stop to this cruelty; and fearing the boy
was murdered, and that they would be
hanged for it, she got assistance, and soon
brought Jock again to himself.</p>

<p>Jock had been accustomed to fight for
his meat, and, in some measure laid his
account with it, so that, on the whole, he
took his broken head as little to heart as
could have been expected,&mdash;certainly less
than any other boy of the same age would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
have done. It was only a little more
rough than he had been prepared to look
for; but had he succeeded in his enterprise,
he would not have been ill content.
The goodwife and her maids had laid him
on a kitchen bed and bathed his temples;
and on recovering from stupefaction, the
first thing he did was to examine his
pockets to see if he had his gully. Alak!
there was nothing but the empty sheathe.
Then he <i>did</i> lose the field, and fell a blubbering
and crying. The goodwife thought
he was ill, and tried to sooth him by giving
him some meat. He took the meat
of course, but his heart was inconsolable;
till, just when busy with his morsel, his
eye chanced to travel to the old place as
if by instinct, and there he beheld the haft
of his valued knife sticking in the bacon
ham, its blade being buried deep in sappy
treasures. He sprang over the bed, and
traversing the floor with staggering steps,
mounted a form, and stretched forth his
hand to possess himself again of his gully.</p>

<p>"Aih! Gudeness have a care o' us,"
cried the goodwife; "saw ever ony body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the like o' that? The creature's bacon
mad! Goodman! goodman, come here!"</p>

<p>Jock, however, extricated his knife and
fled, though he could scarcely well walk.
Some of the maids averred that he at the
same time slid a corner of the ham into
his pocket; but it is probable they belied
him, for Jock had been munching in the
bed but the moment before.</p>

<p>He then went out to his cows, weak as
he was. He had six cows, some mischievous
calves, and ten sheep to herd;
and he determined to take good care of
these, as also, now that he had got his
knife again, not to want his share of the
good things about the house, of which he
saw there was abundance. However, several
days came and went, and Jock was
so closely watched by his master and mistress
all the time he was in the house, that
he could get nothing but his own scanty
portion. What was more, Jock was
obliged every day to drive his charge far
a-field, and remain with them from morn
till evening. He got a few porridge in
the morning, and a hard bannock and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
bottle of sour milk to carry along with
him for his dinner. This miserable meal
was often despatched before eleven o'clock,
so that poor Jock had to spend the rest
of the day in fasting, and contriving grand
methods of obtaining some good meat in
future.</p>

<p>There was one thing very teasing: He
had a small shieling, which some former
herd had built, and plenty of sticks to
burn for the gathering or cutting. He
had thus a fire every day, without any
thing to roast on it. Jock sat over it often
in the most profound contemplation, thinking
how delightfully a slice of bacon would
fry on it,&mdash;how he would lay the slice on
his hard bannock, and how the juice would
ooze out of it! Never was there a man
who had richer prospects than Jock had:
still his happiness lay only in perspective.
But experience teaches man wisdom, and
wisdom points out to him many expedients.</p>

<p>Among Jock's fat sheep there was one
fat ewe lamb, the flower of the flock,
which the goodwife and the goodman both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
loved and valued above all the rest. She
was as beautiful and playful as innocence
itself, and, withal, <i>as fat as she could lie in
her skin</i>. There was one rueful day, and
a hungry one, that Jock had sat long over
his little fire of sticks, pondering on the
joys of fat flesh. He went out to turn his
mischievous calves, whose nebs were never
out of an ill deed, and at that time they
had strayed into the middle of a corn
field. As bad luck would have it, by the
way he perceived this dawted ewe lamb
lying asleep in the sun; and, out of mere
frolic, as any other boy would have done,
he flew on above her and tried if he could
hold her down. After hard struggling he
mastered her, took her between his feet,
stroked her snowy fleece and soft downy
cheek, and ever, as he patted her, repeated
these words, "O but ye be a bonny
beast!"</p>

<p>The lamb, however, was not much at
her ease; she struggled a little now and
then, but finding that it availed not, she
gave it over; and seeing her comrades
feeding near her, she uttered some piteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
bleats. They could afford her no assistance,
but they answered her in the same
tremulous key. After patting her a good
while, Jock began to handle her breast
and ribs, and found that she was in good
earnest <i>as fat as pork</i>. This was a ticklish
experiment for the innocent lamb. Jock
was seized with certain inward longings
and yearnings that would not be repressed.
He hesitated long, long, and sometimes
his pity awoke,&mdash;but there was another
natural feeling that proved the stronger of
the two; so Jock at length took out his long
knife and unsheathed it. Next he opened
the fleece on the lamb's throat till its bonny
white skin was laid bare, and not a hair of
wool to intervene between it and the point
of his knife. He was again seized with
deep remorse, as he contemplated the
lamb's harmless and helpless look; so he
wept aloud, and tried to put his knife
again into its sheathe, but he could not.</p>

<p>To make a long tale short, Jock took
away the lamb's life, and that not in the
most gentle or experienced way. She
made no resistance, and only uttered one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
bleat. "Poor beast!" said Jock; "I dare-say
ye like this very ill, but I canna help
it. Ye are suffering for a' your bits o' ill
done deeds now."</p>

<p>The day of full fruition and happiness
for Jock was now arrived. Before evening
he had roasted and eaten the kidneys,
and almost the whole of the draught or
pluck. His heart rejoiced within him, for
never was there more delicious food. But
the worst of it was, that the devils of
calves were going all the while in the
middle of a corn field, which his master
saw from the house, and sent one running
all the way to turn them. The man had
also orders to "waken the dirty blackguard
callant if he was sleeping, and gie
him his licks."</p>

<p>Jock was otherwise employed; but, as
luck would have it, the man did not come
into his hut, nor discover his heinous
crime; for Jock met him among the corn,
and took a drubbing with all proper decorum.</p>

<p>But dangers and suspicions encompassed
poor Jock now on every side. He sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
down to supper at the bottom of the board
with the rest of the servants, but he could
not eat a single morsel. His eyes were
not fixed on the bacon ham as usual, and
moreover they had quite lost that sharp
green gleam for which they were so remarkable.
These were circumstances not
to be overlooked by the sharp eyes of his
master and mistress.</p>

<p>"What's the matter wi' the bit dirty
callant the night?" said the latter. "What
ails you, sirrah, that you hae nae ta'en your
supper? Are you weel eneugh?"</p>

<p>Jock wasna ill, he said; but he could
not enter into particulars about the matter
any farther. The goodman said, he feared
the blade had been stealing, for he did not
kythe like ane that had been fasting a' day;
but after the goodwife and he had examined
the hams, kebbucks, beef barrel, meal
girnel, and every place about the house,
they could discern nothing amissing, and
gave up farther search, but not suspicion.</p>

<p>Jock trembled lest the fat lamb might
be missed in the morning when he drove
out his flock, but it was never remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that the lamb was a-wanting. He took
very little breakfast, but drove his kine
and sheep, and the devils of calves, away
to the far field, and hasted to his wee housie.
He borrowed a coal every day from a poor
woman, who lived in a cot at the road side,
to kindle his fire, and that day she noticed
what none else had done, that his coat was
all sparked over with blood, and asked
him of the reason. Jock was rather startled
by the query, and gave her a very suspicious
look, but no other answer.</p>

<p>"I fear ye hae been battling wi' some o'
your neighbours," said she.</p>

<p>This was a great relief for Jock's heart.
"Ay, just that," said he, and went away
with his coal.</p>

<p>What a day of feasting Jock had! He
sliced and roasted, and roasted and ate till
he could hardly walk. Once when the
calves were going into a mischief, which
they were never out of, he tried to run,
but he could not run a foot; so he was obliged
to lie down and roll himself on the
ground, take a sleep, and then proceed to
work again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nutrition in the very steams
that issued from Jock's hut; the winds
that blew over it carried health and savoury
delight over a great extent of country. A
poor hungry boy that herded a few lean
cows on an adjoining farm, chancing to
come into the track of this delicious breeze,
became at once like a statue. He durst
not move a step for fear of losing the delicious
scent; and there he stood with his
one foot before the other, his chin on his
right shoulder, his eyes shut and his mouth
open, his nose being pointed straight to
Jock's wee housie. The breeze still grew
richer, till at last it led him as straight as
there had been a hook in his nose to Jock's
shieling; so he popped in, and found Jock
at the sublime employment of cooking and
eating. The boy gaped and stared at the
mangled body of the lamb, and at the rich
repast that was going on; but he was a
very ignorant and stupid boy, and could
not comprehend any thing; so Jock fed
him with a good fat piece well roasted, and
let him go again to his lean cows.</p>

<p>Jock looked very plump and thriving-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>like
that night; his appearance was quite
sleek, somewhat resembling that of a young
voluptuary; and, to lull suspicion, he tried
to take some supper, but not one bite or
soap was he able to swallow. The goodwife,
having by that time satisfied herself
that nothing was stolen, became concerned
about Jock, and wanted him to swallow
some physic, which he peremptorily refused
to do.</p>

<p>"How can the puir thing tak ony
meat?" said she. "He's a' swalled i' the
belly. Indeed I rather suspect that he's
swalled o'er the hale body."</p>

<p>The next morning, as Jock took out his
drove, the goodman was standing at the
road side to look at them. Jock's heart
grew cold, as well it might, when the
goodman called out to him, "Callant, what
hae you made o' the gude lamb?"</p>

<p>"Is she no there?" said Jock, after a
long pause, for he was so much astounded
that he could not speak at the first.</p>

<p>"Is she no there!" cried the goodman
again in great wrath, imitating Jock's
voice; "If ye binna blind, ye may see that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
But I can tell you, my man, gin ye hae
letten ought happen to that lamb, ye had
better never hae been born."</p>

<p>"What can be comed o' the beast?"
said Jock; "I had better look the house,
she's may be stayed in by herself."</p>

<p>Jock didna wait for an order, but, glad
to be a little farther off from his master, he
ran back and looked the fold and sheep-house,
and every nettle bush around them,
as he had been looking for a lost knife.</p>

<p>"I can see naething o' her," said he, as
he came slounging back, hanging his head,
and keeping aloof from the goodman, who
still carried his long pike staff in his hand.</p>

<p>"But I'll mak you see her, and find her
baith, hang-dog," said he; "or deil be in
my fingers an I dinna twist your neck
about. Are you sure you had her yestreen?"</p>

<p>O yes! Jock was sure he had her yestreen.
The women were examined if they
had observed her as they milked the cows.
They could not tell. None of them had
seen her; but they could not say she was
not there. All was in commotion about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the steading, for the loss of the dawted pet
lamb, which was a favourite with every
one of the family.</p>

<p>Jock drove his cattle and nine sheep to
the field&mdash;roasted a good collop or two of
his concealed treasure, and snapped them
up, but found that they did not relish so
well as formerly; for now that his strong
appetite for fat flesh was somewhat allayed,
yea even fed to loathing, he wished the
lamb alive again: He began, moreover, to
be in great bodily fear; and to provide
against the probability of any discovery
being made, he lifted the mangled remains
of his prey, and conveyed them into an
adjoining wood, where he covered them
carefully up with withered leaves, and laid
thorns above them, "Now!" said Jock, as
he left the thicket, "let them find that
out wha can."</p>

<p>The goodman went to all the herds
around enquiring after his lamb, but could
hear no intelligence of her till he came to
the cottage of poor Bessie, the old woman
that had furnished Jock with a coal every
day. When he put the question to her, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
rock and the lint fell out of Bessie's hand,
and she sat a while quite motionless.</p>

<p>"What war ye saying, goodman? War
ye saying ye had lost your bonnie pet
lamb?"</p>

<p>"Even sae, Bessie."</p>

<p>"Then, goodman, I fear you will never
see her living again. What kind o' callant
is that ye hae gotten? He's rather a
suspicious looking chap. I tentit his claes
a' spairged wi' blude the tither day, and
baith this and some days bygane he has
brought in his dinner to me, saying that
he dought nae eat it."</p>

<p>Goodman Niddery could make no answer
to this, but sat for a while grumphing
and groaning as some late events passed
over his mind; particularly how Jock's
belly was swollen, and how he could not
take any supper. But yet the idea that
the boy had killed his favourite, and eaten
her, was hardly admissible: the deed was
so atrocious he could not conceive any
human being capable of it, strong as circumstances
were against his carnivorous
herd. He went away with hurried and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
impatient steps to Jock's wee house, his
old colley dog trotting before him, and his
long pike-staff in his hand. Jock eyed him
at a distance, and kept out of his path, pretended
to be engaged in turning the calves
to a right pasture, and running and threshing
them with a long goad; for though they
were not in any mischief then, he knew
that they would soon be in some.</p>

<p>The goodman no sooner set his nose
within Jock's shieling than he was convinced
some horrid deed had been done. It
smelled like a cook's larder; and, moreover,
his old dog, who had a very good
scent, was scraping among the ashes, and
picking up fragments of something which
he seemed very much to enjoy. Jock did
not know what to do when he saw how
matters stood, yet he still had hopes that
nothing would appear to criminate him.
The worst thing that he saw was the stupid
hungered boy on the adjoining farm
coming wading through the corn. He had
left his dirty lean kine picking up the very
roots of the grass, and had come snouking
away in hopes of getting another fat bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
for his impoverished stomach. But, when
he saw Goodman Niddery come out of the
cot with impassioned strides, he turned and
ran through the strong corn with his whole
might, always jumping up as he proceeded.</p>

<p>The goodman called angrily on his old
dog to come after him, but he would not
come, for he was working with his nose
and fore feet among Jock's perfumed ashes
with great industry; so the goodman
turned back into the house, and hit him
over the back with his long pike-staff,
which made him glad to give over, and
come out about his business; and away the
two went to reconnoitre further.</p>

<p>As soon as the old dog was fairly a-field
again, he took up the very track by which
Jock had carried the carcase that morning,
and went as straight as a line to the hidden
treasure in the thicket. The goodman
took off the thorns, and removed the
leaves, and there found all that remained
of his favourite and beautiful pet lamb.
Her throat was all cut and mangled, her
mouth open, and her tongue hanging out,
and about one half of her whole body a-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>wanting.
The goodman shed tears of
grief, and wept and growled with rage over
the mangled form, and forthwith resolved
(which was hardly commendable) to seize
Jock, and bring him to that very spot and
cut his throat.</p>

<p>Jock might have escaped with perfect
safety had he had the sense or foresight to
have run off as soon as he saw his master
enter the wood; but there seems to be an
infatuation that directs the actions of some
men. Jock did not fly, but went about
and about, turning his kine one while, his
nine sheep another, and always between
hands winning a pelt at one of the ill-conditioned
calves, till his incensed master returned
from the fatal discovery, and came
up to him. There was one excuse for
him, he was not sure if the carcase had
been found, for he could not see for the
wood whether or not his master went to
the very place, and he never thought of the
sagacity of the dog.</p>

<p>When Goodman Niddery first left the
wood, he was half running, and his knees
were plaiting under him with the anticipa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>tion
of horrid revenge. Jock did not much
like his gait; so he kept always the herd of
cows, and the sheep too, betwixt himself
and this half-running master of his. But
the goodman was too cunning for poor
Jock; he changed his step into a very slow
careless walk, and went into the middle of
the herd of cows, pretending to be whistling
a tune, although it was in fact no tune,
but merely a concatenation of tremulous
notes on C sharp, without the least fall of
harmony. He turned about this cow and
the other cow, watching Jock all the while
with the tail of his eye, and trilling his
hateful whistle. Jock still kept a due distance.
At length the goodman called to
him, "Callant, come hither, like a man,
and help me to wear this cow against the
ditch. I want to get haud o' her."</p>

<p>Jock hesitated. He did not like to
come within stroke of his master's long
stick, neither did he know on what pretence
absolutely to refuse his bidding; so
he stood still, and it was impossible to
know by his looks whether he was going
to comply or run off altogether. His mas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ter
dreaded the latter, and called to him in
a still kinder manner, until Jock at last
unfortunately yielded. The two wore the
cow, and wore the cow, up against the
ditch, until the one was close upon her
one side, and the other upon her other.
"Chproo! hawkie! chproo, my bonnie
cow!" cried the goodman, spreading out
his arms, with his pike-staff clenched fast
in his right hand; then springing by the
cow in a moment, he flew upon Jock, crying
out, with the voice of a demon, "D&mdash;n
you, rascal! but I'll do for you now!"</p>

<p>Jock wheeled about to make his escape,
and would have beat his master hollow,
had he been fairly started, or timeously
apprised of his dreadful danger; but ere
he had run four or five steps the pike-staff
came over the links of his neck such a blow
that it laid him flat on his face in a mire.
The goodman then seized him by the cuff
of the neck with the one hand, and by the
hair of his head with the other, and said,
with a triumphant and malicious laugh,
"Now, get up, and come away wi' me, my
braw lad, and I'll let you see sic a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as you never saw. I'll let you see a wally-dy
sight! Get up, like a good cannie lad!"</p>

<p>As he said this he pulled Jock by the
hair, and kicked him with his foot, until
he obliged him to rise, and in that guise
he led him away to the wood. He had a
hold of his rough weatherbeaten hair with
the one hand, and with the other he heaved
the cudgel over him; and as they went the
following was some of the discourse that
passed between them.</p>

<p>"Come away, now, my fine lad. Are
nae ye a braw, honest, good callant? Do
nae ye think ye deserve something that's
unco good frae me? Eh? Ay, ye surely
deserve something better nor ordinar':
And ye shall hae it too."&mdash;(Then a kick
on the posteriors, or a lounder with the
staff.)&mdash;"Come your ways like a sonsy,
brave callant, and I'll let you see a bonny
thing and a braw thing in yon brake o' the
wood, ye ken."</p>

<p>Jock cried so piteously that, if his master
had not had a heart of stone, he would
have relented, and not continued in his
fatal purpose; but he only grew the longer
the more furious.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"O let me gang! let me gang! let me
gang!" cried Jock. "Let me gang! let
me gang! for it wasna me. I dinna ken
naething about it ata'!"</p>

<p>"Ye dinna ken naething about what,
my puir man?"</p>

<p>"About yon bit sheep i' the wood, ye
ken."</p>

<p>"You rascal! you rogue! you villain!
you have confessed that you kend about
it, when I wasna speiring ony sic question
at you. You hound! you dog! you savage
wolf that you are! Mother of God! but I
will do for you! You whelp! you dog!
you scoundrel! come along here." (Another
hard blow.) "Tell me now, my precious
lad, an ye war gaun to be killed, as
ye ken something about killing, whether
would you choose to have your throat cut,
or to have your feet tied and be skinned
alive?"</p>

<p>"O dinna kill me! dinna kill me!"
cried poor Jock. "My dear master, dinna
kill me, for I canna brook it. Oh, oh!
an ye kill me I'll tell my mother, that will
I; and what will Marion say t'ye, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
she has nane but me? Oh master, dinna
kill me, and I'll never do the like o't
again!"</p>

<p>"Nay, I shall take warrant for that:
you shall never do the like o't again!"</p>

<p>In this melancholy and heart-breaking
manner he dragged him on all the way
by the rough towsy head, kicking him
one while, and beating him another, till
he brought him to the very spot where
the mangled remains of the pet lamb were
lying. It was a blasting sight for poor
Jock, especially as it doubled his master's
rage and stern revenge, and these were,
in all conscience, high enough wrought
before. He twined the hapless culprit
round by the hair, and knocked him with
his fist, for he had dropped the staff to
enable him to force Jock to the place of
sacrifice; and he swore by many an awful
oath, that if it should cost him his life, he
would do to Jock as he had done to that
innocent lamb.</p>

<p>With that he threw him on the ground,
and got above him with his knees; and
Jock having by that time lost all hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
moving his ruthless master by tears or
prayers, began a struggling with the force
which desperation sometimes gives, and
fought with such success that it was with
difficulty his master could manage him.</p>

<p>It was very much like a battle between
an inveterate terrier and a bull dog; but,
in spite of all that Jock could do, the
goodman got out his knife. It was not,
however, one like Jock's, for it had a folding
blade, and was very hard to open, and
the effecting of this was no easy task, for
he could not get both his hands to it. In
this last desperate struggle, Jock got hold
of his master's cheek with his left hand,
and his nails being very long, he held it
so strait that he was like to tear it off.
His master capered up with his head, holding
it back the full length of Jock's arm;
yet still being unable to extricate his
cheek from Jock's hold, he raised up his
knife in his right hand in order to open it
with his teeth, and, in the first place, to
cut off Jock's hand, and his head afterwards.
He was holding down Jock with his right
knee and his left hand; and while in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
awkward capering attitude of opening his
knife, his face was turned nearly straight
up, and his eyes had quite lost sight of
his victim. Jock held up his master's
cheek, and squeezed it still the more, which
considerably impeded his progress in getting
the knife open; and, at that important
moment, Jock whipped out his own
knife, his old dangerous friend, and struck
it into the goodman's belly to the haft.
The moment he received the wound he
sprang up as if he had been going to fly
into the air, uttered a loud roar, and fell
back above his dead pet lamb.</p>

<p>Lord, how Jock ran! He was all bespattered
with blood, some of it his own,
and some of it his master's; wanted the
bonnet, and had the bloody knife in his
hand; and was, without all doubt, a wild
frightsome-looking boy. As he sped
through the wood, he heard the groans and
howls of his master in the agonies of death
behind him. Every one of them added to
Jock's swiftness, till it actually became
beyond the speed of mortal man. If it
be true that love lends a pair of wings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
fear, mortal fear, lends two pair. There
is nought in life I regret so much as that
I did not see Jock in this flight; it must
have been such an extraordinary one.
There was poor Jock flying with the speed
of a fox from all the world, and yet still
flying into the world. He had no home,
no kindred to whom he durst now retreat,
no hold of any thing in nature, save of his
own life and his good whittle; and he was
alike unwilling to part with either of these.
The last time he was seen was by two
women on Kirtle-common. He appeared
sore bespent, but was still running on with
all his might.</p>

<p>The goodman was found before the
evening, but only lived to tell how he had
come by his end. All his friends and servants
were raised, and sent in pursuit of
Jock. How he eluded them no man knows;
but from that day Marion's Jock has never
been more seen or heard of in this land.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Cher.</i> That story of our captain's is rather an odd story. Is
it not, Mark?</p>

<p><i>Mark.</i> Rather of the wonderful.</p>

<p class="citation"><i>Ford.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"I dinna ken but I could maybe tell
ye something about him an I liket," said
Tam Craik; "but I wad maybe be as wise
to haud my tongue."</p>

<p>"I wad like very weel to hear mair
about him," said Charlie; "for his life has
had such a queer beginning, it maun surely
hae had a queer end."</p>

<p>"But what an it shouldna be endit yet,
Yardbire," said Tam: "Marion's Jock is
perhaps living, and life-like, to tell his ain
tale. However, we'll say nae mair about
that just now, till you tell us what you
think o' Gibbie Jordan's tale. For my
part, I never heard a tale I was sae muckle
interested in a' my life."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is ane o' the best tales <i>o' the kind</i>
that ever I heard," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"It is a most abominable tale," said the
poet.</p>

<p>"In what way, Master Poet?" said
Charlie: "I dinna like to hear ony body
condemned without reason."</p>

<p>"It is for the badness of the moral that
I do it dislike," said the poet: "The moral
is so truly bad, all mankind it must
must shock; it is to kill this harmless lamb,
the flower of all the flock,&mdash;to feed upon
her lovely form that's fairer than the snow,&mdash;to
eat her flesh and drink her blood! It
makes mine eyes to flow!"</p>

<p>"Gude faith, an I thought that war his
drift, I wad brain him," said Charlie; "and
I confess it looks rather like it."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of it," said
Master Michael Scott: "The maid Delany
is the favourite lamb, whom he wishes you
to kill and feast on in the same delicious
manner as did the hero of his tale; and I
am the goodman whom you are to stick
afterwards, and fairly make your escape."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a shocking tale I really doubt,"
said Charlie; "and throws a disgrace and
an imputation o' something unseemly on
my chief and a' his friends, and I winna
put up wi' it."</p>

<p>"I do propose that from the walls the
caitiff we do throw," said the poet; "or
kill and eat for dainty meat the laird of
Peatstacknowe."</p>

<p>"I fear if the votes were to be ta'en
just now he wad hae an ill chance," said
Charlie: "But it's fair in ha' where beards
wag a'. Let ilk ane of us hae a fair chance.
There may be mae bad morals amang us.
Wha's turn is't next?"</p>

<p>Charlie himself, being next in point of
seniority, was called on for his tale.</p>

<p>"I hae been thinking hard what tale I
should tell you," said Charlie; "but I find
I can tell nought but the thing I hae seen,
and I'll be pinched sair eneuch to make
sense o' that. Therefore, gin ye like, I'll
tell ye my first adventure in war,&mdash;for I

<h3>Charlie Scott's Tale.</h3>

<p>It was under the command of Hab
Elliot that I made my first raide; a gay
rough spun cout he was, and nae cannie
hand for a southland valley. Weel, you
see, there was a chap came to my father's
house at Yardbire ae morning, and he says
to my father, "Wat," says he, (that was
my father's name, what he ca'ed me Charlie
for I dinna ken, for I never spier'd,) "Wat,"
says the chiel, "ye maun raise your lads,
and tie on your wallets, and meet the
warden the morn at the Hawk-Hass, there's
gaun to be a stoure on the east border."</p>

<p>"An there be a stoure on the east border
I's be there for ane," said my father;
"but the de'il ae man hae I left but auld
Will Nicol and the callant Charlie. There
hae seven men o' Moodlaw and Yardbire
fa'en sin Beltan. I canna mak men, but
I shall fight wi' them I have. As for
Charlie, he disna want spirit, but he's unco
young and supple, and will mak but a
weak stand in a strong blast: Auld Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
he kens brawly how to take care care o'
himsel; and, atween the twa, I may be ill
bestedde. But, gae as it will, I'll be there."</p>

<p>I was a massy blade that day when I
gaed o'er Craik-Corse riding at my father's
side. I was sae upliftit I could hardly sit
on my yaud; and I saw my father was
proud o' his callant, as he ca'ed me,&mdash;that
made me ten times waur. The first men
we came at were the lang-shankit Laidlaws
o' Craik; and then the Grahams o'
Drife they came up wi' us; and when we
came to Howpasley, my father got the
laird's right hand, and we gaed ower Skelfhill-swire
seven score and ten, but there
were only fifty o' us had horse, and mine
was ane o' the best."</p>

<p>"Wha's this stripling that rides the good
dun mare," said the laird o' Howpasley.</p>

<p>"That's my bit niff-naff of a callant,"
says my father: "That's my Charlie, cousin
John."</p>

<p>"He's a twig of a good tree," said Howpasley:
"I like the spark gayan weel, if
he wad ride a little evener up, an' no haud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
forrit his head like a woodcock. But, my
word, he has a lang arm!"</p>

<p>"Ay, a pair o' them, cousin," said my
father; and the twa carles hotched and
leuch at my father's joke.</p>

<p>The warden was lying at the Hawk-Hass
wi' twal score o' good men; but there
were nane o' them had horses but the
Elliots, and some gentlemen of the Scotts.
When Sir Ringan saw us coming, he came
out on foot to meet us; and when the gentlemen
of our party saw that, they lighted
off their horses, gae them to their henchmen,
and walked out before the men.
Howpasley walked on the right hand, my
father next, and, as he desired me, I came
slounging up next him. I lookit best on
foot, for my legs were sic a length; I was
higher in fact by half a foot than either John
of Howpasley or my father, but a perfect
tripe for sma'ness. When our captain, the
brave Redhough, came near to us, I thought
I should hae swarfed; my heart dunt-duntit
like a man humblin bear, and I was
maist gasping for breath. I had hard sae<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
muckle o' his bravery that I expectit an
auld, gruff, austere carle, as proud as Lucifer,
to meet us. But, instead o' that, I sees
a boardly knight in the very prime o' manly
beauty: his cheeks were ruddy, his eyes
dark, and the black beard on his booner lip
was just beginning to curl upward. My
heart was a' his ain at the first look; and
I said to mysel, "Ye're the man that I'll
risk my neck wi' ony day." I likit him
sae weel that I mind I thought I could
just hae lain down in a gutter, and letten
him tramp on the tap o' me.</p>

<p>He first shook Howpasley by the hand,
and then my father; and then he gave a
broad look to my beardless face, turning
his eye back to my father's.</p>

<p>"That's my Charlie, Sir Ringan; my
only son now," said my father.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, cousin Charlie, to
our camp," said he: "If ye be as brave a
man as your father, I shall never want a
hero at my side."</p>

<p>I should hae said something in return,
but the deil a word I could say, for I was
like to fa' to the fuffing and greeting. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
spake to a' the gentlemen in the same kind
hamely manner; and then lookit at a' the
men, and spiered how mony belonged to
every ane.</p>

<p>"And how many are with you, cousin
Yardbire?" said he.</p>

<p>"They are a' here that I hae, noble
chief," said my father: "Last year at this
time I brought forty to the field, and now
I hae nae ane but my auld henchman and
that lad. We hae somehow been ower
rash, and I now get a' the wyte. They ca'
me Wat the Waster,&mdash;and not a man will
haud land under me."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Yardbire," said he; "you and
your men hae stood the brunt of the battle
ower often for me and mine. But you are
grown auld, and ye maunna claim the post
of honour ony mair till Charlie come to his
strength. I'll make you captain this day
o' the best troop you ever led. You shall
hae the hard-headed Olivers, the grimy
Potts, and the skrae-shankit Laidlaws; and
you shall form my flying party&mdash;"</p>

<p>My father here interrupted him with
"Na, na, my master, deil a flying troop I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
lead! if it binna a fighting ane, it winna
follow me lang."</p>

<p>The warden smiled; and calling out all
the men of the families he had named, he
put such of them as had horses under the
command of my father. Of these there
were forty-seven, so that our troop consisted
of fifty men in all. We were joined
with the Elliots; but Habby having ninety
men of his own name, the command of
the horse devolved on him, and my father
was only looked on as the second. I didna
like this unco weel; but it coudna be
helped, and I was glad to be in the field
ony way.</p>

<p>The first sight we got o' the English was
frae the top o' Penchrist; but a' that day
we could only ken where they were by the
reek they were raising. My blood boiled
when I saw them burning the houses o'
Scotsmen, and fain wad I hae had a hand-shaking
wi' them.</p>

<p>There was ae message came after another
a' that day. The Kers had been beat
and chased across the river, and the English
host had over-run their territory. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
chief didna seem to care for that sae muckle
as I thought, nor wad he stir his foot till
they crossed the Rule. There war mae men
came in every hour, for the beacons were
a' bleezing; and as soon as the English set
foot on the territory of the middle marches,
away we rade straight to meet them.</p>

<p>It was on the hill of Hawthornside where
I first saw the face o' an enemy; and I'll
never forget sic queer strummings as I
had within me. Oh, I wad fain hae been
at them! There was a kind o' yeuk,
a kind o' kittling, a sort o' prinkling
in my blood like, that I fand wadna be
cured but by the slap o' a sword or the
point o' a spear. Instead o' being feared
for a wound, I wad hae gi'en my horse and
light armour baith to have had a good
prodd frae an Englishman,&mdash;but I wad hae
liket that the warden had seen me.</p>

<p>We kept the hills between them and the
border wi' our horse, but the foot kept the
straits to the westward. Forbye the Elliots,
and my father's troop o' Potts, and Olivers,
and skrae-shankit Laidlaws, the warden
had three hundred Scotts on horseback; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that in all he had short o' five hundred
horse, and about eight hundred foot. At
the head o' his horse he rade straight up to
the faces o' the English, and challenged
them in our king's name to tell their business
in that place. Up came an English
knight, Sir Robert Neville of Ravensworth,
and he crackit baith proudly and saucily,
but I didna ken weel what he said. He
threatened no to leave a beast or a body
atween Borthwick and the Border. Our
captain was as crouse as the other, sae there
was nothing but ill blude atween them;
but the thing that we likit warst of a' was
the certainty that he had eight thousand
men, being just sax for our ane.</p>

<p>The warden then held a council o' friends
upon the top of the hill, and in view of
the English host. Some said ae thing and
some said another to him; but at length he
turned to my father, and he says, "What
says our cousin Walter o' Eskdale to a'
this? But I needna speer that,&mdash;he never
gae me aught but ae advice a' his life."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I wad do, captain,"
says my father: "Afore yon sun were twa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
cock-strides down the west I wad fight
them."</p>

<p>"I kend what it wad be," said the warden.
"But, my brave Yardbire, are you
considering the disproportion o' force?"</p>

<p>"What's that to think about?" said he,
"the greater the better!"</p>

<p>The warden claspit him in his arms, and
the tears came hopping down my muckle
soft flobby cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes, captain," continued my father, "I
hae been thinking o' the odds against us,
and I am thinking o't just now. But ye
ken art may do muckle."</p>

<p>"Now, to hear him speaking about art!"
said the warden, pushing him playfully
around by the shoulder,&mdash;"To hear a
man speaking sagely about art, that never
thought of ony other art in his life but hard
hand nevel! Pray now, my dear cousin,
will ye let us hear this deep profound art
o' yours, that will enable ae man to beat
half a dozen?"</p>

<p>"I wad form our little army into the
shape o' a wedge," said my father; "and
I wad yerk that little wedge into the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of their great log of an army, and split it
a' to shivers."</p>

<p>"G&mdash;d a mercy, hear to him!" cried the
warden. "And pray what is to form the
point o' this wedge, Yardbire?"</p>

<p>"Just my grey naig's head, captain."</p>

<p>"I kend weel what it wad come to, cousin.
Your grey naig's head wad soon be
cracked; but an ought were to happen
yours, what wad come o' me?"</p>

<p>I thought sae muckle o' my auld father,
that I couldna haud my tongue nae langer,
and that was the first word I ever spake to
the warden in my life. "Never fear, my
master," quo' I; "it winna be ilka ane that
sal crack his grey crown the day."</p>

<p>"Weel said, Charlie!" cried the auld
hero; and he waved his cap round his head,
"Weel said, little Charlie! Now, captain,
for the wedge!"</p>

<p>The warden lookit a good while at us
without speaking, and I gart mysel trow
there was a blink o' admiration in his dark
eye; "Ah, Wat, Wat!" said he; "weel
do you ken I'm ower ready to follow your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
mad schemes! But they have sae often
proved successfu', though wi' very hard
wark, that I'll e'en take the risk, and sey
your skill aince mair."</p>

<p>He then drew his horse from the height
into the glen behind, and formed them
precisely on my father's plan, with a troop
of horse in front, and one on each wing,
the foot being arranged in close column
in the middle; and as my father claimed
the post of honour as his right, he rode
the front man: Will Nicol and I were
next him, and behind us there were four
of the Laidlaws. I saw no farther, but
was informed after that when the horse
made the charge, the foot had orders to
run and keep up with them.</p>

<p>We took a sweep down the water to
the north, and appeared all of a sudden
in the rear of the English army. Their
scouts had seen us, but could not guess our
intent; for as to a thought of our attacking
them, that never entered their heads,
so that their host was not new-modelled
farther than their columns facing about
toward us. They deemed we were going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to retreat toward the north, and were
making ready to pursue us, when all at
once the point of the wedge turned at a
right angle, and rushed with all haste on
the centre of their line.</p>

<p>Then there was such a hubbub, and calling,
and noise of armour rattling throughout
their army as I had never heard!
My father spurred on, and, after some few
hard blows, opened the line. He had the
least to do of any, for the ranks opened
naturally before him as he heaved his
heavy sword. But ever as their wedge
grew thicker, their columns being pressed
together, lay the heavier on our flanks,
and several gallant men of the Scots fell.
I saw naething o' this, but soon fand the
effects of it; for my father drove faster on
than the flankers could bear up after him,
and our point lengthened out and grew
thinner at every step. I had been unco
keen o' fighting, but I got my fill o't then.
I trow I gae some o' them some gay good
yerks on the chafts.</p>

<p>Ravensworth by this time perceiving
the danger in which his army stood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
being divided, brought up his side columns
and closed around our front. I
heard him saying in a loud exasperated
voice, "For shame, countrymen! for
shame! will ye suffer a landward Scots
laird, an auld crabbit loun like that, to ride
in through your ranks and out through
your ranks, as they were files o' thistles?
Down with the moorland thief! down
with him!"</p>

<p>"Aha, Robin o' Ravensworth, is that
you?" cried my father: "An I win
within sword's length o' you I shall settle
your crack."</p>

<p>As he said this he raised himself up in
his stirrups. Auld Will Nicol roared out,
"For Christ's sake, master, stop!" But,
in place of that, he spurred up to the captain
with all his might, challenging him to
come forward. Neville kept his ground,
and prepared for the attack, but refused
to come forward; and, just as my father
and he began to measure swords, my father
was struck by six or seven spears all at once
on his left side. Some of these he received on
his buckler, but others of them pierced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
side, and, before any of us could lend him
the least assistance, he was unhorsed.
Ravensworth also gave him a wound as
he was falling. I, who was close behind
him, and a-head of all the rest, was now
hard bested. I clove the head of the first
spearman on my left; and ere I had recovered
my sword from the stroke, Ravensworth's
sword was at my breast; and
I have no doubt that stroke would have
slain me, had it not been for a plunge
made by my father's horse, that came between
us and marred it. By this time the
Laidlaws had come up on my right,&mdash;a
wheen as hardy, determined louns as ever
brak warld's bread,&mdash;and they were laying
about them like incarnate devils. The
horse kept the lancers from reaching me
on the left, so that Ravensworth and I
met fairly hand to hand. Sure am I that
I never gae sic a straik sinsyne, nor ane
wi' sic good will. I dinna think I clave
his helmet, but I gae him sic a devil o' a
knab on the temple, that he was stoundit,
and fell as dead as a stane at my horse's
feet. My father was at that time on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
knee, and I saw him trying to raise himself
up by the stirrup-leather, for he had
never yet quitted the bridle of his horse.
He saw me bring down Neville, who fell
almost at his very side; and he looked to
me, and cried, "Weel done, little Charlie!
weel done, my brave man!"</p>

<p>That was the last word I ever heard
him say. My brave, worthy, auld father!
He was sae used to ca' me little Charlie
when I was young, that he coudna gie it
ower when I grew bigger than him; and
he cried to me, "Weel done, little Charlie!
Weel done, my brave man!" I'll never forget
that moment. My honest, kind-hearted
father! Ye maun forgie me, sirs, for taking
a hearty greet at this part o' my tale.
Mony a ane hae I ta'en at the same bit.&mdash;Ay&mdash;he
often ca'ed me little Charlie, and
he cried, "Weel done, my brave man!"
That was the hindmost word, and I hae
good right to mind it.</p>

<p>The battle thickened, and thickened
round us, and we were borne back; for
there was sic a rush made by the English
to the rescue, that, an their captain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
been living, they wad hae tramped him to
pieces. I was driven clean stupid, and
cared nae ae preen for my life, after I saw
the ranks rush over my father; but the
skrae-shankit Laidlaws defendit me, and
did most excellent work. I never saw ony
men that thought less about fleeing or retreating
than the Laidlaws. Pell-mell,
swap for swap, was a' that they countit
on. I heard Davie o' Craik saying to his
brother, "Take care o' that lang swabble
Charlie, and keep by his side. Deil hae
him, gin he be nae better than he looks
like." The grim Potts were mair cunning
than rash; and the hard-headed Olivers
could be led but never driven. The Laidlaws
were the men for me. Pell-mell,
yank for yank. "Thresh on, Will!" "Ay,
here's w'ye, Davie; deil tak the hindmost!"
I hae stood mony a stoure wi'
the Laidlaws, and never wished for better
lads&mdash;lang-shanks and a' thegither.</p>

<p>But I'm forgetting my tale; for aince I
get into the mids o' a battle, it's no easy
getting me out again. I canna tell you a'
the feats that were done that day, espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>cially
by the warden. When he saw the
great brulzie in front, he came up with
the Scotts, and the Johnstons, and the
Grahams o' Drife,&mdash;and hearing that my
father had fallen, and that the English captain
was also slain, he took the front himself,
and scattered the English commoners
like crows.</p>

<p>When we had thus fairly broke through
the centre, we turned to the right, and
drove that division of the army before us
till they took shelter in Jed forest; but
seeing the rest, who formed the strongest
wing, marshalling up behind us, we drew
off to the hills, and encamped that night at
the Brae of Rule.</p>

<p>There was heavy mourning for the loss
of my father, and we buried him next day
at Hassendean. The English were as much
exasperated. Dick Neville, the brother of
Sir Robert, took the command, and up
Teviot they came, laying all waste behind
them. We durst not engage them again
in close battle, for they were by far too
numerous; but we kept hovering around
them, and harrassing them whenever we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
could get a chance. In spite of all we
could do, they took the town of Hawick,
plundered it, and burnt it to ashes. The
warden was neither to haud nor to bind wi'
anger then; and, as he durst not leave the
country, nor tine sight o' them for an hour
himself, he sent off Hab Elliot and me, wi'
our hunder and fifty horse, to plunder the
castle and lands of Ravensworth, by way of
retaliation.</p>

<p>"Now, Charlie," said he to me at parting,
"Mind what the Nevilles hae done
baith to you and me, and neither leave
them cow nor ewe, man, woman, nor bairn,
blanket nor sheet, dish nor spoon."</p>

<p>Aweel, aff Habby and I set; he wi' his
Elliots, and me wi' my hard-headed Olivers,
my grimy Potts, my skrae-shankit Laidlaws,
and auld Will Nicol,&mdash;that was my
army, and a gay queer ane it was: I
hadna a man o' my ain name but mysel;
for the warden kept them a' about him:
He wadna part wi' the Scotts at no rate.
It was clear moonlight, sae we set off before
sun-set and rade a' the night, keeping
aye the height between Tyne and Reid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and at daylight we fand oursels at the
place where the twa Tynes meet. We
were terrified for raising the country, and
were obliged to ride out to a little hollow
place in a wild moor, and hide oursels a'
the day, where our horses got nothing but
a rive o' heather, but they had plenty o'
water, puir things! Habby kept watch
himsel, and let us a' sleep; and there was
ae camstary English chap that wad be up
to the tap o' the hill reason or nane, Habby
chappit aff his head&mdash;he wasna very sticking
that way.</p>

<p>The next morning after that, we gae the
castle o' Ravensworth and the rich domains
o' the Nevilles an unco surprise. Habby
gaed up by himsel to the gate, and asked
a word o' the porter. The man came
snooving out half sleeping. Habby had him
dead, and the keys in his ain hand, in half
a minute. It was a shamefu' morning that;
for we killed, and harried, and burnt a' that
came afore us; and Lady Ravensworth was
burnt, and her bairn was trowed to be
burnt. That sat sair on my conscience, for
she came to me and beggit her life. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
nae thought o' taking her life; but I was
sae intent on the spulzie, that I lost her
again, and never saw mair o' her. It was
rather cruel o' Habby to lock every door
when he set fire to the castle. I saved ae
little chap that morning, though I wasna
muckle the better. We were flinging blankets,
and sheets, and thousands o' things
out at a large window, when I hears a
bairnie greeting most bitterlie, and aye crying
out, "Daddy, daddy! O daddy, daddy!"
"Poor little English brat," says I to
mysel, "there's nae daddy near you." Sae
I could nae help rinning into the room to
see what kind o' creature it was; and there
lay a fine bonnie callant on the bare bed-strae,
for they had pu'ed the down bed,
and blankets, and sheets, and a' off him;
and when he saw me, he held out baith his
hands, and cried, "O daddy, daddy!" I
could nae think to leave him to be burnt,
sae I rowed him in some blankets and tossed
him out at the window; and when I
lookit out after him to see if he wasna killed,
I heard him crying louder than ever,
"Daddy's boy fa'en! Take ye up, take ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
up! O daddy, daddy! take ye up, take ye
up!"</p>

<p>When we came to pack up our goods he
was still lying sprawling amang the blankets,
and insisting on his daddy taking him
up as fervently as before. I was wae for
the poor thing, and didna ken what to do,
for I didna like to be nursing a bairn afore
my new warriors. But as luck wad hae
had it, up comes Will Laidlaw o' Craik.
Will cared nae what ony body thought.</p>

<p>"What, lad?" says he to the boy:
"What's the matter, billy? What are ye
lying yammering there for? Eh?"</p>

<p>"Daddy's good boy fa'en," says the
child; "O take ye up! take ye up!"</p>

<p>"Poor deevil!" says Will, wi' his muckle
een wauling till they were like to come
out; "Poor deevil! Indeed and I will
take ye up, though I should get nae mair
o' the spoil for my share but yoursel."</p>

<p>Will fauldit a blankit, and rowed the
callant carefully up in't like a web. He didna
come weel behand at rowing up a bairn;
but he did as he could, and had the sense
to leave the head out, which was a main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
concern. Just at that very moment, when
Will was at the thrangest, by comes ane
o' the Olivers in a great haste wi' his sword
drawn, and it was a' bloody. Now,
thinks I to mysel', the puir bairn's gane;
for I saw what kind o' chap he was that
Oliver. Will unluckily had the boy's head
out o' the blanket, and was busy speaking
to him without regarding ony thing else;
and ere ever he was aware Oliver heaved
his bloody sword, and was just coming
down wi' a swap on the boy's neck, and he
wad hae cuttit it through like a kail castock.
Will's e'e caught a glimpse o' the
sword as it was coming down, and with a
dash of his elbow he drove it aside. "Eh?
What are ye about, min?" said Will, speaking
over his shoulder, and keeping his body
between Oliver's sword and the child.</p>

<p>"Ooh? What are ye about min?" returned
the other, mimicking Will's voice
and manner: "Hae ye nought ado but to
work on a dirty English paddock like that?
Cut the neck o't."</p>

<p>"Will I, min?" says Laidlaw: "I'll see
you d&mdash;d first, and a' the Olivers atween<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Jed head and Tyot stane&mdash;humph? A
bonnie trick to come and meddle wi' me
and my bit bairn!"</p>

<p>Oliver went away laughing at Laidlaw,
leaving him to manage his nursing concern
as he could.</p>

<p>I had witnessed Will's undaunted bravery,
and yet I canna say but I was as weel
pleased wi' this bit kind turn as ought I
had seen him do. I think I see him yet
wi' the child in his arms foussomly rowed
up in a blanket, like a web&mdash;the head o'
the boy out, a great neuk o' the blanket
hinging down to the ground, and Will
glowring back at Oliver's face: "Eh?
What are ye about, min? A bonnie story,
to come and meddle wi' me and my bit
bairn!" Ha! ha! ha! Honest Laidlaw! I
can never forget him and his bairn. "Cut
the neck o't," says the other. "Will I,
min? I'll see you d&mdash;d first," says Will.
Ha! ha! ha! ha!&mdash;But then his look!
that was the best sport ava; wi' his bendit
face and muckle great wulcat een turned
o'er his shoulder. "Cut the neck o't," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Oliver. They that had seen Laidlaw then!
ha! ha! ha! "Will I, min?" Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class="break">"My son, is there not a time for every
thing?" said the friar. "If thou thinkest
at all on our condition and thine own,
surely thou wilt refrain from such a torrent
of vain jesting. Remember that the
words of thy mouth are for death or life;
for the possession of maiden beauty, and
love, and pleasure; or for the most dismal,
and miserable, and wretched of all fates&mdash;to
be killed and eaten up of thy brethren,
the companions of thy journey."</p>

<p>"Gude faith, the thing's hardly to be
thought of, let be spoken about," said
Charlie. "But I beg your pardon, callants,
I maun get on wi' my tale; for if I stick it
in the middle, ye ken it is a' ower wi' me."</p>

<p>"I wish you would get on with it then,"
said Tam; "for if ye maun aye stop to
laugh at your ain jests, we'll be a' dead o'
hunger or ever the votes be ta'en. Nane
but fools laugh at their ain sports."</p>

<p>"Whisht, whisht, Tam," returned Charlie,&mdash;"I
hae a gay wide wizen when I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
amang friends, but there are some things
that I canna swallow for a' that&mdash;Where was
I at? Aye at the sacking o' Ravensworth."</p>

<p class="break">We drave the richest prey that morning
that I ever yet saw liftit, if we had gotten
it a' hame. We had thirty horses laden wi'
stuff, and other thirty led anes, besides
thirteen score o' good cattle; and we gae
the banks o' the Teme and the Blackburn
an unco singe afore we left them. I was
rather against the burning, but Habby
wadna be stayed; "Na, na; tit for tat,
Charlie. That will stand for Hawick and
Abbotrule."</p>

<p>We drave on, and drave on, as fast as the
cattle could gang, and some o' the heavy
soft anes we were obliged to leave behind
sair against our wills. We were terrified
for raising the country, for we had sic a far
drive: but luckily the Nevilles had ta'en
amaist every man with them in their expedition
into Scotland; and the first time
that we hovered was on Tersit-moor in
Northumberland, a little before the break
o' day. At that place there was the stran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>gest
thing happened to us that ever happened
to men,&mdash;and it was for that that I
began my tale.</p>

<p>My heart had been unco sair a' the night
wi' thinking about the bonnie Lady Neville
o' Ravensworth; and I had often been
sae grieved about her death, and her bairn's
death, that I hardly kend what I was doing.
I thought I saw her kneeling on her
knee, and begging of me to spare her life,
and the life o' her child; and then how
cruel it was in me to rin away rummaging
up the stair, and lose the opportunity of
preserving her. These thoughts had made
my heart wholly inclined to pity, and, as
soon as we lighted, I sought out Will Laidlaw
o' Craik, to see if he had still been
able, amang a' the confusion, to preserve
the life of the child. Will had had a great
deal o' trouble wi' him, chiefly from his associates,
but he had him still safe an' sound.
He had stuffed him in a horse's pack o'
blankets and sheets, <i>wi' his head out</i>, and
had kept beside him a' the gate; and now
when I found him he had laid the boy
down on the heather to sleep, and had him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
weel happit up, and Will himsel was lying
streekit beside him. He thought that I
wad gibe him about the business, and tried
to waive the subject; but when I told him
how much I was pleased wi' what he had
done, he grew rather crouser, and could
speak about naething else but the boy and
his little sayings to him by the way. "Poor
little dear soul!" said Will; "I think some
body had flung him o'er the castle wa' in
an armfu' claes, and never kend; and wha
kens but he may be the heir o' Ravensworth
himsel. He has been sae miraculously
saved that he will surely come to
something. But do ye ken, Charlie, my
heart is already sae closely knitted to that
bit helpless bairn, that I wadna see ony ill
come ower him for a' the kye on the Crib-Law."</p>

<p>"Laidlaw, you shall never rue your
kindness o' heart and attentions to that
puir misfortunate bairn," quo' I: "The moment
that I saw you take him up, and row
him in a blanket, <i>wi' his head out</i>, as ye had
been rowing up a wab, I resolved to reward
you wi' my hale share o' the spulzie."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never speak about that, Charlie; if we
get safe hame wi' every thing we'll no differ
about the spulzie."</p>

<p>"Ha, but Will, your rowing up o' the
bairn was a rare scene! ony other body but
you, ye ken, wad hae taken the creature up
in their arms and rowed a blanket about it:
but instead o' that you doubled a pair o'
blankets their hale length on the green,
laid the bairn across the one end o' them,
and rowed it ower the body, and ower the
body, and ower the body, till ye came to
the far end; and it was but ill rowed up
after a'&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Hout, Charlie! deil a bit but ye're
ower muckle ta'en up about trifles. I wish
ye wad think mair about the perilous situation
we are in. Watch a wee while,
and let me get a sleep."</p>

<p>Will then laid his arm over the boy and
the hott o' claes, and fell sound asleep.
Our men were a' placed two and three
around the hale muir to guard the cattle,
and all were resting on their arms, to be
ready to rush together on any alarm. I
was sitting and keeping a good look out a'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
round about, and Will he was swuffing
and sleeping. Every thing was quiet, except
now and then that the hum of an ox
was to be heard which missed his neighbour,
or the eiry whistle o' the moss-plover.
It was a while before the day-sky, and I
was just beginning to turn drowsy, when
I thought I saw something white on the
muir, about two hundred strides from me.
"St Mary be my buckler!" said I to mysel:
"What can you be? It is surely a
flight o' white mist risen out o' the earth,
for I see it moving. If it be a mist fawn,
as I dare say it can be naething else,
it has drawn itself up into a form the likest
that of a woman of ought ever I saw." As
I was mumbling and speaking this to mysel,
I perceived that it still drew nearer,
and that it wasna ane o' the fairy fawns o'
mist whiles to be seen stealing about i' the
night-time, but a lady a' clad in white.
It glided athort the moor, and athort the
moor, as if it had been looking for something
it had lost; and at last I saw it spring
away from one point to another at a considerable
distance, as swift as a flash o' fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
as if something had startled or offended it.
I learned after that the point from which
it fled was the very spot where Habby
Elliot lay, and who at that time was lying
in a sound and troubled sleep. When it
again stopped, its motions were very extraordinary,&mdash;for
though the morning was
dark, there was such a pale and a pure
whiteness about it, that I saw it the better.
It was like a streamer o' light, or the reflection
of a starn in the water, that aye
in the darkest nights appears brightest.
When it paused at the place I mentioned,
it bent its body backward, its arms
were crossed on its breast, and I saw like
its hair streaming in the air behind it.
Then it spread both its hands toward
heaven, as in the act of making fervent
supplication. From that point it came
straight toward me, after giving a shiver
that made all my een dazzle.</p>

<p>"Will Laidlaw!" cried I, but in a violent
whisper below my breath; "Will
Laidlaw o' Craik! for God's sake waken
up, and see what this is."</p>

<p>I was sitting, but Will sprang to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
feet, and seized his sword. "Where?
where? where? Where is it, Charlie?
Where is it, callant?" whispered he. I
pointed to it, but durst not speak. Will
rubbed his een and rubbed his een, and at
length perceived it. "I do believe, lad,
that is some hizzy&mdash;and a weel dressed
ane she is," said he; still speaking in a
whisper, and sitting down close beside me.
"What on God's earth can she be seeking
on this waste at sic an untimely hour?"
I durst hardly draw my breath, let be to
answer him; and sae he continued, "I
think it wad hae been as decent-like an
she had lain still in her bed rather as comed
raiking out amang a wheen wild men on
sic a wild height. Oho! I'll wager my
neck it is some spy in disguise."</p>

<p>She was by this time within ten paces
o' us, and we both sat still in breathless
suspense till she came close to us. I thought
I had seen the face before, but couldna tell
where, till she kneeled on one knee at
my feet, crossed her hands, and looked me
in the face with the most piteous expression
of countenance. Then I saw it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was the lady o' Ravensworth, and in the
very posture that I had seen her for the
first and last time. Yet there was no
anger in her face; it seemed merely a look
of supplication; and at length she touched
her lips three times, as an intimation that
she wished to speak and could not. As
for me, my mouth was sealed; and that
I might see nae mair than I had seen, I
threw mysel agroof, wi' my face to the
ground, and held by the heather firmly wi'
baith my hands.</p>

<p>Honest Will had nae suspicions o' ony
thing beyond nature; and at length he says,
"What are you wanting wi' us, Madam,
that ye're making a' thae murgeons?"</p>

<p>"You do not know me," returned she,
"but that young warrior beside you does.
He has been guilty of a neglect that he
will rue till the day of his death. But,
for another deed of mercy that you and he
have done, your fates are averted, and
your heads shall be covered in the hour
of danger, which is fast approaching. You
have saved a child from the devouring
flames;&mdash;if you dare to wrong a hair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that child's head, how dreadful will be
your doom! There is a terrible hour approaching;&mdash;look
at his breast that you
may know him again, for I cannot see the
fate of the day. But if you would thrive on
earth and be admitted into heaven, guard
and preserve that dear child&mdash;That child
is mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say nae mair, honest woman," says
Will, perfectly undismayed, "an the child
be yours you're perfectly welcome to him.
It was to save his bit innocent life that I
brought him away, and no for ony greed
o' other folks bairns. I kendna wha was
aught him, but sin he be yours I'll deliver
him safe into your hands. Take care an'
no let him get cauld, for the morning air
is no gude for a bairn."</p>

<p>So saying, Will howked the boy out o'
the mids o' a great heap o' claes, rowed
him up as weel as he could, and then said,
after two or three sobs, "I like ill to part
wi' him, but a mother's aye a mother."
Then he kissed him, and added, "Fare-ye
weel, my wee man! You and I will may-be
never meet again; but, whether or no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
you will be nae the waur o' a trooper's
blessing. An ye be spared ye'll be a man
when auld Will Laidlaw's head is laid i'
the grave. Hae, honest woman, there's
your son, and God bless you baith!"</p>

<p>She bent her body over him in the most
affectionate way, and stretched her arms
as if to embrace him, but she neither
touched him nor any part of Laidlaw's
claes. The boy had awakened, and when
Will held him out to give him up to his
mother, he cried out, "No-no-no-no. No
go ty'e, no go t'ye. Daddy's boy feared,
daddy's boy feared."</p>

<p>"Gude faith, sae ye may, my man!
thinks I to mysel, "an ye kend about a'
this as weel as I do!"</p>

<p>I saw naething that was passing, for I
was lying close on my face, and hinging
by the heather; but I heard a that was
said, and Will tauld me the rest afterwards.
He said, she made the sign of the
cross above her child's breast, then over
his own head, as he stooped forward with
him in his arms. Then she glided aside,
and made the cross over my head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
shoulders, and it was heaven's grace that
I didna ken, else I wad hae swarfed away.
Last of all, she again bent herself over her
child, and stretched out her arms on each
side of him; then, leaning herself back on
the air, she arose gently from the ground,
and sailed away through the dim shades
of the morning toward the verge of the
heaven.</p>

<p>I wondered what was asteer then, for I
heard Will crying on the Virgin Mary to
preserve him, and rhaming o'er the names
o' a' the saints he had ever heard of; and at
length he gae a great gluther, like a man
drowning, and fell down wi' sic a dunt he
gart a' the moss shake again. The bairn
screamed and grat; and I didna ken what
to do, for I durstna look up for fear o'
seeing the ghost; till at length I heard
that the rest of the sentinels had caught
the alarm, and were passing the watch-word
frae ane to another, and then I ventured
to set up my head. But, gude and
gracious, sic a grip as I did haud by the
heather!</p>

<p>I took up the child, covered him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
my cloak, and soothed him; and the poor
little harassed thing hid his face in my
bosom. Will lay quivering and struggling
like ane in a dream, or under the influence
of the night-mare; and, after I had
rolled him three times over, he awoke in
the most horrid consternation. "Charlie,
where are ye? Speak to me, Charlie, and
tell me where I am." Then a whole string
o' saints and angels were a' invoked, one
after another, ower and ower again. "Mercy
on us, Charlie! I hae had sic a dream
as never mortal man had; and a' sae plain
and sae particular, I could amaist swear it
was real. What do ye think, Charlie?
Didna this bairn's mother come to me in
my sleep? and she says to me, 'That
bairn's mine.'&mdash;Na, that wasna what she
said first. 'Ye dinna ken me,' says she."
And then Will began and told me all that
I had heard pass between them before,
and all that I had seen, and some part
that I had not seen; but a' that I could
do, I couldna persuade him that it wasna
a dream. And it was better it was sae;
for if he had kend and believed that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
conversed with a spirit, it wad hae put him
daft. It pat me clean out o' my judgment;
and for that day, and mony a day
and night after, I kend nae mair what I
was doing than ane dreaming, and remembered
nae mair what I had been doing
than if I had been asleep all the time. I
can therefore gie but a puir and a lame
account o' what followed, for it is maistly
from hearsay, although I was tauld that I
bure a principal hand in the fray.</p>

<p>We started at the scraigh o' day, and
drove on. There were always four or five
light horsemen, well mounted, who rode
before our array to see if the coast was
clear; and as we went round the head of
the Gowan Burn, about mid-day, ane o'
these came galloping back, and told us
that the English were awaiting us at the
fords of Keilder, with an army of a thousand
horse.</p>

<p>"Aha!" quo' Habby Elliot! "I thought
we warna to get hame this way. We
hae just twa choices, callants, either to
fight or flee."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>There was not a man in all our little
army that could think of scampering off
for bare life, and leaving such a prey behind
him; so, with one assent, we rode
forward in a body to the brow of the hill
that overlooks the fords of Keilder. The
English were stationed on a rising ground
to the west of the river, and that being
passable only by one ford, which was very
rough, we could not attack them without
the certainty of being cut to pieces; so
we kept our station on the steep brae over
against them, and sent some few of our
oldest and weakliest men to be moving
the prey out toward Keilder-head.</p>

<p>We calculated the English to be about
five hundred; but neither durst they cross
the ford to come to us. They sent a few
flights of arrows among our men, which
we regarded very little, and determined,
if possible, to keep them at bay there till
our rich prey had crossed the border fell.
But just at the fall of the evening, to our
great surprise, the English rushed at once
into the ford, with loud and reiterated
shouts; and scarcely had we begun to ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>vance
down the steep to meet them, when
we were attacked by another body of horsemen
behind.</p>

<p>These men were led by a great priest
whose name was Bishop Boldone, but who
was always called Bloody-Sark; and at the
very first encounter Hab Elliot rushed among
the English ranks and slew the
Bishop with his own hand at the first blow.
But it cost Habby dear, for he was cut
down in endeavouring to retreat, and fell
under a dozen of spears. In short, our
small band, being inclosed between two
stronger bodies, was literally hewed in
pieces, but not before they had slain a great
number of our enemies. Will Laidlaw and
I fought side by side; and though enclosed
in the very middle of our foes, we cut our
way through, and escaped without a wound,
and with short pursuit.</p>

<p>Our prey was gone. We saw a great
part of them scattered on the hills, and
heard them lowing, as they returned toward
their native pastures. Our drivers,
having watched the fate of the day, made
their escape when they saw us surrounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
abandoning the spoil. We two fled in silence
toward the north-east, and could not
even get time to look for the child, in whom
we were both so much interested. We
had lost our well earned prey; we had lost
our friends and companions in arms, and we
had lost our honour by suffering ourselves to
be surprised by the ambush behind; yet we
both felt as if the loss of the child sat heavier
on our hearts than all. There was
something so mysterious in our connection
with him, that it could not fail making a
deep impression on our minds. The vision
that we had seen, and the promise that had
been made to us,&mdash;that "for what we had
done our heads should be shielded in the
day of battle,"&mdash;soon recurred to us, and we
both agreed that our escape was miraculous,
and perfectly unaccountable to ourselves.
There were not two in the battle
who exposed themselves more, and Laidlaw
averred that he sometimes saw twenty
weapons raised against us at once, and that
still, as we approached, the bearers of them
seemed to lose the power of striking. It
was no wonder that we were impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
with deep awe, nor that we both wished it
had been in our power to have preserved
the boy, over whose life there seemed to
be some good guardian spirit permitted or
appointed to watch. Our conversation
was all about him. There had been a nest
made for him in a pack of clothes. Laidlaw
had led the horse himself all the way,
and the child had chatted to him, till the
alarm was given that we were waylaid, and
he had then given the horse in charge to
one of the drivers, with particular injunctions
to take care of the child; but he could
not even remember who that driver was.
I came up immediately after, and charged
the lad to take care of the child; and, in
the hearing of several of my followers, said
that I would rather they lost the whole
drove than that ought should happen to
him. But now we had lost him; we had
lost all but our horses and our swords.</p>

<p>We jogged on all the night in melancholy
mood, crossed the Border, and then
turned westward toward the Cowd-Peel,
which we reached about sun-rise. A little
after the break of day, as we were coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
through a hollow of the height, called the
Spretty-Grain, we perceived something before
us that appeared to be moving, and of
a prodigious bulk, which, after some hesitation
we made up to, and found that the
phenomenon consisted of eight horses, all
well loaden, and every one with its head
yerked to the tail of the one before him;
and all these were driven by one yeoman
on horseback, who rode beside them with
a long goad in his hand.</p>

<p>We soon overtook and examined him;
and never was I so much astonished in my
life as when I found it was my own henchman
auld Will Nicol. He was very dour
and shy of communication at first.</p>

<p>"Will Nicol! Is it you?" said I. "How
in the name of wonder did you escape?"</p>

<p>"Humph! I think I may as weel speir
that question at you: Humph!" says Will.</p>

<p>"I thought you had fallen with the rest
in the battle," said I.</p>

<p>"Humph! but I'm here," says Will.
"And I think there's mae here nor me:
humph! and I rather think I hae brought
mair wi' me nor some fock: humph! I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
comed as fu' handit as some fock, I think.
Humph!"</p>

<p>"But, Will, were you in the engagement?"</p>

<p>"What need ye speir that? humph!
Where was I else but in the engagement?"</p>

<p>"And did you stay till it was over?"</p>

<p>"Humph! I stayed lang aneuch, I think!
humph! It is needless to wait ower lang on
a seen bad job. Humph!"</p>

<p>But the real truth of the story was, that instead
of staying till the battle was ower, Will
didna stay till it began, nor near that time.
He was an auld-farrant chap Will, and had
a great deal o' foresight; and when he saw
us begin to stop, and the English standing
peaceably before us, <i>herding us</i>, as he ca'ed
it, he was sure there were more enemies
coming up behind.</p>

<p>"Will, if I were sure that ye deserted our
cause, and came off before the engagement
began," said I, "although I have not a man
left that I ken o', but Will o' Craik and
yoursel, may I be a coward and a traitor if
I wadna cut you down i' the place where
you stand."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Will had nothing to say for himself but
"Humph! humph!" and he scratched his
head and grumbled. I was quite indignant
at the old fellow, and was getting into
a greater rage than ever I hae been in
at a friend sinsyne, when all at once I heard
a weak tremulous voice say, "Daddy's
boy cold."</p>

<p>"Aih-hay-hay!" shouted Will Laidlaw,
as loud as he could yell: "Hilloa, hilloa,
hilloa!"&mdash;and he sprang first on the back of
his own horse with his feet, and from that
he darted upon one of those that carried
the packs. When I rode up he was sitting
on the rumple o' the beast, hugging
the child, that he had deemed lost, in his
bosom, kissing him, and exclaiming,&mdash;"Aih,
my man! my dear man, are ye safe?
are ye safe? God bless auld Will Nicol!
God bless auld Will Nicol!"</p>

<p>It was impossible for two down-cast and
broken-hearted warriors to be more uplifted
at any incident than Will Laidlaw and
I were, at discovering that the boy was
safe; and even auld Will Nicol began to recover
some confidence.&mdash;"I heard you giv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>ing
a chap some charges about him, that I
kend weel caredna if his head were off,&mdash;od,
he was ane o' the hard-headed Olivers. What
cares an Oliver for a man's life, or a bairn's
either?&mdash;Sae I thinks, sin my young master
has ta'en a liking for the bairn, I's e'en
gang and look after him. It is a good sign
of a young warrior to like to save women
and bairns. Sae I gangs, and sae I thinks
sin I is bringing away this wee chap out
o' danger, I may as weel bring something
wi' me as naething; sae I brings aught o'
the best horses, and the best laden anes
that I could wale, and bound for the Border.
A fashous job I hae had wi' them a'
night."</p>

<p>It is needless to tell how frankly auld
Will was forgiven.</p>

<p>The Cowd-Peel being a rallying point
on all Border raides, we stayed there a
whole day and a night, in hopes that some
part of our men wad come up; but out of
all my fifty men there were none appeared
but three of the Potts. The hard-headed
Olivers had been slain to a man, and all
the Laidlaws save my brave companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Out of ninety valiant Elliots there were
only twelve remaining, and some of these
were of the drivers.</p>

<p>There were fifty-seven Scots, and nearly
as many English, with Bloody-Sark at their
head, buried in one cairn; and, for the
sake of the Bishop, the English raised a
heap of stones above them as huge as an
abbey church, which will be seen on the
height above the ford of Keilder for ever.</p>

<p>Laidlaw slept that night in a good bed
with the boy in his arms, for we had no lack
of the finest blankets and sheets; and that
night the white lady appeared to him again,
claiming her child, yet still declining to accept
of him, and promising Will protection
on earth and a reward in heaven if he continued
to guard and protect that boy. Whether
this was in a dream or not, Laidlaw
could not be positive; but he rather inclined
to think he was wide awake, for he remembered
of speaking to her audibly.
Among other things, she asked him if he
knew it was the child that had slept by
him on the waste the night before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
battle. Will said he was sure. She asked
him how. He answered, that "unless the
fairies had changed him it could nae be
ony other."</p>

<p>"But the fairies or some one else may
change him," said she. "You may be separated
amid the confusion and uproar
now on the Border; and when you meet
again, you may not be able to prove the
identity of my child. I bade you the other
night examine his bosom, but you neglected
to do so. If you had, you would there
have found the spur of Ravensworth, testifying
his lineage and descent to all the
world."</p>

<p>Will came to me in a great ferment the
next day, and told me of all this. I had
heard the same words the night before the
battle, but had quite forgot them among
other matters, and wist as little what they
meant as Will did.</p>

<p>"I hae lookit a' his bits o' claes, and
graepit them a'," said he; "but I can find
nae spur. How could there be a spur about
a nakit bairn? It is may be in amang the
blankets."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is perhaps some private mark," said
I. "Let us examine the child's body very
narrowly."</p>

<p>On doing so we found a slight mark on
his breast, that seemed to have been made
by applying a hot iron at some time previous,
and it was exactly in the form of a
V with the wrang end uppermost. So we
both concluded that this was a private
mark of some family, that neither fairies
nor men kend o', and that it was perhaps
a stamp that keepit them a' away.</p>

<p class="break">"It is the stamp of the heirs lineal of
the house of Neville," said the friar; "I
have impressed it with my own hand, after
many masses and Ave Marias said. What
became of that child? or whither is he
gone? I pray thee to inform us in the
words of truth not lengthened out."</p>

<p class="break">Alas, I cannot tell! He was visited by
the white lady of Ravensworth every
night, and when the gloaming came she
would be seen hovering on the skirts of
the wood near to him. I grew that I durst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>na
sleep a night within ten miles o' him,
and Will Laidlaw turned clean bumbazed
about the thing; sae we were obliged to
send him to board wi' auld Lady Lawder,
her that was put out o' the convent for
witchery and the ill arts. She cared nought
about spirits, and conversed wi' the white
lady as she had been her door neighbour;
and it was said there were strange mysterious
sayings past between them. She
book-learned the boy, pen-learned the boy,
and learned him mony other things foreby
that were thought to be nae better
than they should hae been. She chauntit
sangs til him, and tauld him tales, and,
there was little doubt, meant to breed him
up to be a terrible enchanter; but afore
that could be effeckit, the white lady came
and took him away a' thegither.</p>

<p>From that day he has never been seen
or heard of in this world, neither as boy
nor man. And now, sirs, I find that my
story's worn to a head hair, and that I
maun cut it short. So it is done, and that's
an end til't.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have been a skipper in my time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something more. Anon, I'll tell it you.<br /></span>

<p>"It is nae worth the name of a story
that," said Tam Craik; "for, in the first
place, it is a lang story; in the second
place, it is a confused story; and, in the
third place, it ends ower abruptly, and rather
looks like half a dozen o' stories linkit
to ane anither's tails."</p>

<p>The poet was by this time on his feet,
and, coming forward to Charlie, he looked
him sublimely in the face, stretched out
his hand, and spoke as follows: "There is
some being, wheresoe'er he dwells, that
watches o'er the fates of mortal men: now
do I know it. Yea, and that same being
has spirits of all casts at his command, that
run, and fly, and trim, and trim, and trim
about this world. And it is even true
that I have seen of these, yet knew them
not. Look here, brave hero, man of heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and hand! and see if thou canst note thy
mark once seen? Thy spur; thy A without
the crossing stroke; thy V with the
wrong end upmost,&mdash;is it here?"</p>

<p>The poet bowed his breast, and exposed
it to Charlie's eye, which, at the first scrutinizing
look, discerned the mark he had
formerly seen,&mdash;the mark of the spur of Ravensworth.
Charlie's visage altered into
lengthened amazement. It could scarcely
have been more strongly marked when
he was visited by the white lady on Tersit
moor, even when he was glad to hide his
face in the moss, and hold by the heather
with both his hands.</p>

<p>"And are you really the chap that I
threw out at the window in the castle of
Ravensworth," said he, "and boarded wi'
auld lady Lawder? The creature that had
a ghaist for its guardian, and a witch for
its nurse? But what need I spier? My
ain een convinces me. Gude faith but we
are a queer set that are prickit up on the
top o' this tower thegither! I am amaist
terrified to enquire where you have been
since the white lady took you away; for ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
must have been in the fairy land, or the
country o' the gruesome ghaists, or perhaps
in a waur place than either."</p>

<p>"We are a queerer set than you are
thinking of," said Tam; "for here am I
standing, Tam Craik, liege man and true
to the brave Scottish Warden, and I carena
wha kens it now; but I am neither less
nor mair a man than just Marion's Jock o'
the Dod-Shiel, that sliced the fat bacon,
ate the pet lamb, and killed the auld miser,
Goodman Niddery. Here's the same
whittle yet, and ready at the service of ony
ane that requires it for the same end. Od,
we seem to ken mair about ane anither
than ony ane o' us kens about ourselves."</p>

<p>"The day wears on apace," said the
Master; "and I foresee that there is relief
approaching from more quarters than one."
(This made all the party spring to the windows
to look.)&mdash;"It is not yet visible to
your eyes, but it will come time enough.
In the meanwhile, it would be as well to
get through with the stories, that we may
know and fix on our victim, for, perhaps,
we may need a mart this night. And, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
being now your turn, liegeman Thomas, or
John, by right of seniority, if you know
of nothing better I should like much to
hear the adventures of such a promising
youth, from the day that you made away
with the farmer to this present time."</p>

<p>"Better, Master Michael Scott?" said
Tam. "Better, does your honour say?
Nay, by my sooth I ken o' naething half
sae good. I hae been an ill-guided chap
a' my life; but, as you will hear, I hae guided
others at times but in a middling way."</p>


<h3>Tam Craik's Tale.</h3>

<p>My friend, the laird, has given you
my early history, perhaps better than I
could hae done myself, but that is to judge
of. He hath added and diminished,&mdash;but
yet he told his story wi' some life, and a'
the better that he didna ken wha heard
him. In one thing he was wrong informed,
for I was not seen on Kirtle-common
that night I fled from the slaughter
of the old inveterate wretch. I ran in
a contrary direction, and slept that night
in a moss-hagg, at the head of a water cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>led
Lanshaw Burn. Many a hard night I
have had, but that was one of the bitterest
of them all. I did not rue having killed
the goodman, for I rejoiced at having let
out his dirty miserable life and saved my
own,&mdash;but then I was sure to be taken up
and hanged for a murderer; and I was
chased away from my mother and my
country, and durst not face a human being.
I saw some goats and some sheep, and
would gladly have killed one to have eaten,
for I saw hunger staring me in the face;
but they would not let me come near
them. I likewise saw a shepherd's or forester's
house, but kept aloof; and going
up into a wild bushy glen, I cried myself
asleep, half naked as I was, and slept till
about the break of day. When I awakened,
starving with hunger and cold, I had
no shift but to pull rashes and eat the
white ends of them, which I continued to
do all that day whenever I came to a rash
bush. The next night I came to a solitary
house, where I ventured to go in, and
there I first gave myself the name of Tam
Craik, telling abundance of lies as to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
origin. The master of the house was a
wealthy vassal, and had great numbers of
fat oxen, with cows and calves, besides a
few sheep, and he kept me to help him to
herd these, promising me a grey coat if
I attended to his satisfaction. He was
a most extraordinary man, and none of
the best,&mdash;for his words and actions were
at variance: Though he conversed with me,
or any one, with the utmost familiarity, I
never found out that he had told me one
word of truth. The first friend that came
to visit him after my arrival, he overloaded
so with kindness, professions of friendship,
and respect, that I believed he loved him
as his own soul; and, after he was gone, as
my master and I went out to the fields, I
observed what a treasure it was to have so
good and so valued a friend as he had in
that neighbour of his. What was my astonishment
to hear from the same tongue
that had lauded him to the skies, that he was
a cheat, a liar, and a scoundrel;&mdash;a greedy
sordid wretch that robbed his own hinds,
and such wandering pedlars as came by
that road, not daring to venture on higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
game; one who seduced men's wives and
daughters indiscriminately; and was, in
short, a perfect demon, and a pest to the
whole neighbourhood. "But, master, why
did you caress and commend him so much
to his face?" "O! that is all very well;
that goes all for nothing. He is to be sure
a vile scoundrel!" "There are queer people
in this world," thought I: "There is
nothing for it, I see, but, <i>Tam, mind yoursel</i>."</p>

<p>The farmer continued very kind to me
in his own deceitful way; but the meat that
we got was very bad. It consisted of lean
beef, and venison as black as soot, with
plenty of milk; but as for bread we had
none of any description. So, from the day
that I entered to his service, I determined
to kill a lamb, or a sheep of any sort, the
first time I could get one; but I never
could get the least chance, and might as
well have tried to get hold of a deer. I
could not help thinking of the delicious
feasting that I had in my little shieling,
dear as it had like to have cost me; and
every day my appetite for fat flesh became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
more insufferable, till at last, by a grand
expedient, I got satisfaction of it. I had
thirty fat stots in my herd, and I observed
that, in hurrying them through a bog,
they sunk, and stuck quite fast: so, having
no other resource, I drove a few of them one
day, when I was very hungry, into a mire
in a wood, and rushing forward on them
while they were struggling, I sticked the
fattest among them to the heart, so that
he floundered and bled to death in the
slough. "Well done again, Marion's
Jock!" said I to myself. "Here is feasting
for you now! Here is a feast that
will last you a twelve month at odd
times, if you can but preserve it." I declare
when I began to cut up that huge animal,
I almost trembled at my atrocity; but
these kind of feelings soon wear off. I
was obliged to eat some collops that day
without any cooking, and never relished
ought better; I wish we saw such a meal
again! My thin yellow beard was a little
discoloured to be sure, but that was nothing;
I washed it, and went home as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
boldly among the rest as if nothing wrong
had been done.</p>

<p>When I returned to my prey, I found
to my great grief that the foxes, dogs,
ravens, and every savage beast and hind
on these mountains, were determined to
share with me; they had actually eaten
more in that one night than would have
served me a week;&mdash;so the next day I
employed myself in cutting off all the
good, fat, and savoury pieces, and secreted
them in well-springs, covering them up
with stones; this I did to preserve them
from the beasts and from putrefaction; and
that day I am sure I had at least ten stones
weight of excellent beef,&mdash;the white and
red were so beautifully mixed, it did one's
heart good to look at it.</p>

<p>Pleasures are of short date, and the
greatest pleasures have the shortest! My
master went over the lake next day to look
at my herd, and I knew the ox would be
missed. Had it not been for my beloved
beef I would have made my escape forthwith;
but my heart was knit to it, and for
my life I could not leave it. I went home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
at night in great terror, but to my joy I
never saw my master half so kind. He
told me I had suffered one of my stots to be
stolen, but what could the like of me help it:
he had a rough guess who had taken him,
and would perhaps make him repent it. I
was perfectly overjoyed at this construction,
and resolved to revel in feasting and
gladness; but next day when I went back
to my ox, the hide was neatly taken off
him, so also was the head, and both were
taken away. This was perfectly unaccountable
to me; and I saw the marks of
men's feet in the mire, confirming the fact
that some body had been there stealing
the head and the skin of my ox, which
were in my eyes not worth half the labour
of taking them off. I knew not what to
make of this, but it was evident that my
prey had been discovered by some one;
and all that I could calculate farther on was,
that the hide had been stolen by some body
who stood in need of it for shoes, and the
head by one who wanted bugle-horns. It
was all one to me, as I grew more and
more a favourite with my master, who now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
began to caress me more than his own
sons. No young lad in the land could be
more thrifty about meat than I was. Being
anxious to have the remainder of my
bullock out of sight, I stole salt and a small
barrel, and salted my stuff in a hole below
ground; then, when no very good meat
was going by day at my master's house, I
often fasted the greater part of it, and then
taking a coal by night, I stole away into the
wood, and roasted, and boiled, and feasted
the whole night. The beef was delicious,
and it was amazing what great quanties I
sometimes snapped up at once; for even
after I thought I could eat no more, there
was a part of white marrowy substance about
the joints, and the sides of the bones, that
I could not give over&mdash;no man could give
it over. Marry, how delicious it was! I
account that fine meat mixed with white,
that lies wedged in along the doublings
and shelves of the bones, as the most glorious
species of man's food;&mdash;round the
broad shoulder-bone, for instance, the spool-bone,&mdash;that
through which we look for the
storms. Think but of the layers of the red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and the white that lie bedded around that.
Peatstacknowe, let me feel your shoulder.
I suppose a man has no spool-bone,&mdash;ah
no!&mdash;none! Blessed Virgin! when shall I
again shire the long crooked slices of the
red meat, mixed with white, from the flats
and the hollows of a broad spool-bone!</p>

<p class="break">"He is hungering and yearning to pick
my bones, the cannibal dog," said Gibby.
"But it brings me in mind of a good saying
and a true: The swine that is most
eager to feed itself is the first slaughtered

<p>"The horse-leach hath drawn thee aside
from thy onward relation, thou froward

within thee."</p>

<p class="break">The loss of this sturdy ox of my master's
gave rise to strange matters; matters
which quite confounded my judgment,
and which to this day I do not comprehend.
My master went away to the sheriff,
and the lord of the manor, and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a complaint that his neighbour before-mentioned
had stolen one of his cattle, the
best that he had on his farm. This was the
man that he caressed so much, yet knew to
be a scoundrel. The complaint was attended
to, and the injury deeply resented. My
master returned with a strong body of
men, and orders to seize Glendairg, and
search all his premises; and if evidence appeared
against him, he was to be carried
before Lord William, called the Severe,
and there imprisoned in the dungeon till
time should be given him to clear himself,
which, if he failed to do in a certain period,
he was to be swung. All my master's
servants, men and women, were ordered
to proceed with the party; I went
among the rest, and certainly never witnessed
so curious a scene. Glendairg came
out and met the party with all the consciousness
of innocence; and even when
he was seized and bound, he still appeared
to doubt of the sincerity of the men, espepecially
when they told him it was at the
instance of my master.</p>

<p>"If that is all, it is well," said he; "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
am sure my kind friend and neighbour can
mean me no ill by it."</p>

<p>My master took him aside, and said to
him in the kindest and most soothing
manner, "Do not be the least disheartened,
my dear friend: You know how far I
would be from injuring you. I would not
do it for all the cows in my byre. I ken
weel wha has the ox. There is little doubt
but he is in our neighbour Bauldy's beef
stand. I have long suspected him, and
many is the good beast I have lost. You
little know how many good beasts I have
lost, and was still so loth to make it public.
But I can suffer it no longer. Let the
skaith fall upon the skaither. In the mean
time I know you are quite innocent, but
I instituted this search as a blind to him:
You must just submit and never mind it."</p>

<p>"O, very well, neighbour, very well,"
said Glendairg; "I knew you could not
intend me any ill,&mdash;search all out and in,
and welcome."</p>

<p>They did so; they searched all out and
in, and at last, when about to give up,
they found the individual ox's hide that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
slew in the bog, lying hid deep below some
hay and corn in the corner of a barn. In
another place still more unfeasible, they
found the ox's head. They were both laid
upon the green, and my master and all his
servants, myself included, swore to their
identity, as we could not do otherwise.
Glendairg looked like one bewildered, and
said there was a plot laid against his life,
which he neither understood, suspected,
nor merited. The shrieve's officers laughed
him to scorn, and proposed to hang him
up on the nearest tree; and I believed
they would have done it, had it not been
for the kindness of my master, who came
forward with tears in his eyes, and addressed
them somewhat thus:</p>

<p>"Alas, my masters, this is a heavy and
a sorrowful sight for me! This is the bitterest
day of my life! I have lost many
and many good cattle, and yet I would
not,&mdash;I could not, let myself suspect my
intimate friend. Think how I am grieved
to see these proofs. Yet perhaps he may
be innocent, and this may be some vile
plot laid against his life. I beg, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
that he may be set at liberty, and the
whole business hushed up."</p>

<p>"You are a good man and a kind," said
the men; "but this thing must not be.
With our lord and master, justice must
have sway; but we will report your goodness
and generosity to him, and be sure it
will not go unrewarded. We can assure
you, that this man has not only forfeited
his life, but all his farms, as well as his
stock of cattle and sheep to yourself."</p>

<p>For all this my master refused to be
comforted, but wept and followed after the
men, pleading for the life and the freedom
of his friend, but he pleaded in vain; the
men bound him on a horse, and carried
him away with them to the dungeon of the
castle of Coombe. I marvelled greatly at
the great kindness and generosity of my
master, knowing, as he did, that the man
was a scoundrel; but I wondered far more
what could induce the man to steal the
hide and the head from off my ox.</p>

<p>My master was a married man, and
had four children; and though he was apparently
a kind husband, his wife seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
quite unhappy and discontented, which I
thought highly unreasonable on her part.
She knew more, however, than I did; and
there are some small matters that women
never patiently put up with. He had a
number of servant-maids for the purpose
of milking cows, making hay, and cheeses,
and such things; and among them there
was a very pretty one named Kelly, with
whom he had fallen in love; and, after
long toying and courting, he had seduced
her. I knew nothing about these sorts of
concerns; but I thought Kell, as we called
her, the most beautiful, sprightly, and innocent
being that lived, and I liked to look
at her and hear her speak; and whenever
she came near me, I was like to fall a-trembling.
She slept with a little child in a
large open loft, above the room where my
master and mistress slept; and it so happened
that something came by night and
frightened her, and she refused to sleep
there any longer without some one beside
her. I slept by myself in one of the out-houses;
and it was immediately proposed
by my master that my bed should be removed,
and put up in the loft beside Kell's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
I was drunken with delight at hearing this
intelligence; yet I pretended to be very
averse to the plan, hanging my head, and
turning about my back, when any one
spoke of it, nor would I answer a word to
one of them but "Tutt," or "tutts."</p>

<p>"Tam Nosey, it seems ye're gaun to be
bedded wi' bonny Kell the night?"</p>

<p>"Tutt!"</p>

<p>"Ye're gaun up to sleep beside her, and
do ye think ye'll never brik lair?"</p>

<p>"Tutt!"</p>

<p>"She's a bonny burd yon, Tam, ye
maun tak care."</p>

<p>"Tutts!"</p>

<p>Well, up I went the next night to sleep
in a bed that stood side by side, or rather
end by end, with that of Kell. Oh I was
so terrified for her, or for having any communication
with her, that I would not
speak a word even when she spoke to me,
but covered myself over the head with the
bed-clothes, and lay puffing till I was like
to choak for want of breath. I did not
sleep well at all. I could not sleep, for she
was always yawning, and then saying,
"Heigh-ho!" and then hushing the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to sleep. The next night I ventured to
lye with my head out from beneath the
clothes, unless when she spoke, which
alarmed me exceedingly; and so I did the
next night again, behaving myself with
great magnanimity. At length I came to
that pass, that when she spake to me I did
not creep down beneath the bed-clothes,
but only made a great bustle and flinging
as if I <i>had been</i> hiding myself. This practice
of deception I continued for several
nights, always making more and more
pouncing and scraping every time she
addressed me. She laughed at me, and
seemed highly amused, which made me
still the worse. At length she said one
night, "Pray do not creep through the
house for fright; what makes you so afraid
of me? what ill do you think I will do to
you? Heigh-ho, Nosey! I wish the bogle
may not come to-night. I am afraid it will
come, for I thought I heard it. Look that
it do not rise at the back of your bed, for
that is a very dangerous place. If it come,
Nosey, I must either come in beside you,
or you must come in beside me."&mdash;"Tutts!"
said I, and that was my first word of court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>ing;
the first syllable that I spoke to Kell
in that luckless loft. I said, "Tutts!"</p>

<p>I suspected no evil intention on the part
of my kind and indulgent master, and far
less on that of Kell; indeed, how could I
suspect either? One day he said to me in
the fields, "I do not know what to do
about you and that wench Kell: for both
your sakes I believe I must separate you.
She is fallen in love with you, quite over
head and ears, and has been complaining
to our dame of your unkindness to her.
We have a great regard for the girl, and
cannot part with her,&mdash;but, out of respect
for you both, you must be separated. I
will, however, trust you together until
next week; and if she do not complain any
more, you may remain where you are; but
I suppose I will be obliged to part with
you then, though against my will."</p>

<p>This was a terrible stound to my heart,
and shewed my master's masterly policy;
for, notwithstanding of all my pretended
aversion to the company of women, and
to that of pretty Kell in particular, I would
not have been parted from her at that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for all the world, not even for all the beef
and bacon that was in it. I did not know
well how to make up matters with her so
as to retain my place, but I thought I
would try. So that night I sat down on
my own bed-side with my clothes on, and
scratched my head, and beat with my bare
heel against the loft; but she had lost all
hope of gaining me to the measures agreed
on between her and her master, and took
no heed of me till I was obliged to speak
first myself, when the following highly
interesting dialogue passed between us:</p>

<p>"I'm unco feared the bogle come the
night, Kell."</p>

<p>"So am I!"</p>

<p>"I wasna sure, but I thought I heard
it yestreen!"</p>

<p>"I aince thought that I heard it a wee
too!"</p>

<p>"How does it play when it is gaun to
rise?"</p>

<p>"It begins a scart, scarting, like a rattan,
making holes, I fancy, to come out
and take us away."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aih! then it has just been it that I
heard!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'se warrant it was, and that I
heard too!"</p>

<p>"Ay; O it's terrible! we're ill, ill set
here! but I'll watch a' night, and keep it
aff you, Kelly."</p>

<p>With that I came and sat down on the
side of her bed, to keep the invidious
scratching bogle away from her; but I
soon became drowsy, and was like to fall
down. She begged me to lay down my
head on her pillow, but I would not hear
of that. Oh! no, no, I durst not lie down
there; so I stretched me on the loft at her
bed-side, and fell asleep. Awakening before
day, the first thing I heard was the
bogle scratching. Kell had stretched her
arm below the bed, on the side opposite
to me, and was scratching slowly and
fearfully; then, pretending to awake, she
hid herself among the bed-clothes, muttered
prayers, and cried, "Heigh-ho!" I
groaned; and, stretching my hand round
the corner, scratched on the other side,
even more solemnly, and at more awful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>tervals
than she had affected; so that we
lay in great tribulation till the dawning of
the day.</p>

<p>Afraid that I had still been too slightly
obliging, and that I run the risk of being
separated from her, I studied the whole
day on the most becoming way of conducting
myself, and entered on several most
amorous resolutions; but the higher my
resolves were, the more pusillanimous was
my behaviour when put to the test. I durst
not even touch the side of her bed that
night; but the wicked unsonsy bogle still
continued its scratchings, sometimes on
the one side of the bed, and sometimes on
the other, I was therefore obliged once
more to sit down on her bed side, to guard
her from its inroads. In sitting there I
dropt asleep, and my head fell down on
her pillow&mdash;it was impossible I could help
that; and then she kindly laid the uppermost
coverlet over me for fear of my catching
cold; but I was by far too sound
asleep to perceive it. She had to pull the
covering from below me, in order that she
might lay it above me,&mdash;for all that I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
not awake, which was a great pity, but
always as she made the greatest stir, I
sniffed the louder. A while after, I turned
myself about, and gave my head a ketch
toward the back of the bed, till my cheek
came in contact with something soft; but
it was in my sleep,&mdash;and I was in one so
so profound, that I could not possibly know
what that thing was. What a fright I got
next morning on perceiving my situation!
I sprung from the bed, and ran away to the
hills to my charge, without speaking a
word.</p>

<p>I was, however, quite intoxicated with
delight, and endeavoured to ingratiate myself
with my master, by paying every possible
attention to his behests, lest I should
lose so delightful a place both for stolen
meat and approaching pleasures, which I
perceived would still grow more and more
sublime, and was glad when he said to me
one day that Kell had given over complaining
of my rudeness and incivility, and
he would trust me as her companion for a
little while longer. In the mean while, I
was to take care and do nothing impro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>per;
but he had such trust to put in me,
he was not afraid of that.</p>

<p>He was informed every day by this subservient
beauty how matters proceeded; so
he let them go on by degrees till they arrived
at such a crisis as he desired, which
was no more than a boy lying on a girl's
bed-side with his clothes on. He then
came up with a light one night at midnight
to see how his child was resting,
pretending that he thought her ill, and
found me lying sound asleep, where perhaps
I should not have been, though I was
as innocent and as free of his mistress as
the child that lay in her bosom. He was
in great wrath, and pulled me over the bed,
giving me two or three gentle thwacks
with his open hand: he also rebuked her
very sharply, but said to us before going
away: "Keep your own secret. For both
your sakes I will conceal what I have seen,
although you have acted so <i>very</i> improperly;
but let me never catch you in the
like fault again. If the church get hold
of you, you are both undone."</p>

<p>I was dreadfully ashamed; and thence-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>forward
felt my heart quite reckless and
desperate, disregardful of all danger or propriety;
and my master made me still worse
by telling me that I was to part from Kell
in a few days, but that he did not like to
put me away just then, for fear of awakening
suspicions against us, for he had a great
regard for us both! I laid all these things
to heart, and could not then have staid
from Kell's bed-side a night, if my head
had been to answer for it next day. One
night we were informed that some strangers
had come to the house and were making
merry, and before we went to bed our
master sent us something to eat and drink.
I thought there was something going on
that night, for I heard a great deal of muttering
and saying of paternosters till a late
hour. However, I took up my old birth,
and after a while fell sound asleep. About
midnight we were awaked by four or five
gruff looking fellows, with long beards,
and staves in their hands, who ordered us
both to get up and dress ourselves. Our
master made a speech to them, lamenting
our guilt, and, with tears in his eyes, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>seeching
their clemency toward us; but
at the same time said, that he could not
suffer such immoralities under his roof: he
had a family of his own coming up, and
bad example was pernicious. Then he
related what strict injunctions he had given
us, yet we had continued to persist in
our wicked unlawful courses; that, therefore,
he had been obliged to give us up as
lawless and irreclaimable delinquents.</p>

<p>All that he could now do was to intreat
theirs and the holy fathers' merciful clemency
towards the youthful offenders; for
that, although we had both mocked and set
at defiance the statutes of holy church,
he had hopes of our repentance and amendment:
And with that he delivered us over
to the officers of the church, whom he had
trysted and suborned for that purpose.
They said he was a good man, but that
the offenders must needs suffer a heavy
penance, in order that they might be again
rendered pure and without blame, in the
eyes of their fostering and protecting parent.</p>

<p>When Kell saw that she was betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and abandoned, her grief and despair knew
no bounds, and she would doubtless have
accused her master to his face had she been
able to articulate aught distinctly,&mdash;but she
fell into fits, and they hurried her away.
We were confined to cells in different religious
houses, but both in the same ward.
It is well known what tyranny prevails here,
and what vengeance is wreaked against all
those guilty of breaches of morality, especially
if those possessed of riches or power
desire it; but it is nothing to that which
predominates over the west country, where
I then was. They fed me on bread and
water, though I asked for fat flesh, and
longed for it every hour of the day: and
always when the people assembled to worship,
I was put in the juggs; that is, I was
chained to the kirk wall with an iron collar
about my neck, and every boy brought
a rotten egg, or some filth, and threw at me,
till I was all over bedaubed and plastered
like a rough stone wall. The men gave
me a kick, and the old maids spit upon me
as they passed, but the young women
looked on me with pity; and the old wives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
before my time of penance was expired,
espoused my cause, and defended me from
the rabble. I heard them saying to one
another, "Poor fellow, somebody may be
the better o' him yet. What wad the mother
that bore him say if she saw him
standing in that guise? Surely she wad
think the punishment far outwent the
crime."</p>

<p>One day, just when I was about to be
set at liberty, I saw my kind master speaking
to some of the holy brethren, and was
glad when I saw him, thinking I saw the
face of the only man on earth that cared
for me. But he came with a different intent
from what I supposed, namely, with
the benevolent one of getting me hanged.
He said he had missed some money out of
his house ever since I came away; and
though he should be sorry indeed to find
any part of it on me, for his own satisfaction
he requested to search my clothes in
their presence, to which I submitted without
reluctance, being conscious of my innocence.
But he that hides knows best
where to seek. It was not long before my
kind master took out from between several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of the button-holes in the breast of my
grey coat, two gold moudiwarts, three silver
merks, and several placks and bodles.
In vain did I protest that I knew nothing
about them; the brethren pronounced me
the most incorrigible wretch and vagabond
that traversed the face of the earth; and,
as their jurisdiction extended not to such
crimes as this, they sent me off with the
proofs of my guilt to Lord William for
judgment and execution. I shall never
forget the figure I cut that day when
brought before Lord William, and accused.
I was in a wretched state as to clothes,
having stood so long in the juggs. I had
been hungered almost to death, and maltreated
in every way, and altogether looked
extremely ill. He asked them to go
over the charges against me, when one of
the brethren came forward and spoke to
him as follows:</p>

<p>"My noble Lord and benefactor, a worthy
gentleman within our bounds of censure
and controul, lodged a complaint with
us against two of his servants that had
been tempted by the devil to fall into law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>less
and sinful communication; and notwithstanding
of all his admonitions and
threatenings of church discipline, they not
only continued in their mal-practices, but
every day grew worse and more abandoned.
He therefore prayed us to take cognizance
of the offence, which, for the sake
of their souls, and the general benefit of
our community, we undertook. Accordingly,
my lord, as he suggested, we went
disguised as strangers, and at midnight we
found this same young gentleman lying
snugly in bed beside our friend's principal
maid-servant, the very maiden to whom he
had entrusted the care of his children, one
of whom lay in the bed with them. Think
of the atrocity of this my lord, and look at
the man!"</p>

<p>The judge did so, and could not help
smiling.</p>

<p>"What do you say to that master?"
said he, "Is it truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I.</p>

<p>This answer made him burst out a laughing.
"Upon my word," said he, "you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
are a most extraordinary youth! Was the
girl pretty, say you, monk?"</p>

<p>"The woman was indeed very beautiful,
my lord."</p>

<p>"She has been blessed, however, with a
singular taste. I think the stripling may
almost be excused for this crime."</p>

<p>The monk then related the circumstances
of the stolen money having been found
on me, at which the judge shook his head,
and said, "Alak, it is all over with him.
He is unfit to live. What do you say to
this, sirrah? Is it true?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I.</p>

<p>"True that you stole your master's money?"
said he.</p>

<p>"No, I never stole it, but it is true that
it was there."</p>

<p>"What? you found it I suppose? Tell
me the truth, did not you find it?"</p>

<p>"No, I never found it, nor ever saw it
till it was taken out of my coat yesterday.
I never had either gold or silver in my hand
in my life."</p>

<p>"Your woman took it and sewed it in
for you, then, I suppose?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know who took it, or how it
came there, but there it certainly was."</p>

<p>"Did you ever part with your coat to
your sweetheart? Did you ever lend her
it to mend, or leave it at home with her?"</p>

<p>"I have often on warm weather left my
coat at home for three or four days rinning."</p>

<p>"But you declare you did not take the
money?"</p>

<p>"I never saw the money, nor heard of
it till yesterday."</p>

<p>When I said this, he looked stedfastly
on me as if he had discovered something
he saw not before. There was no man on
earth could discover truth like Lord William.
"Who is this youth's accuser?"
said he. They told him it was sleeky Tam.</p>

<p>"I have observed of late," said he, "that
that gentleman never searches that he does
not find, and never accuses that he does
not bring proof. I have caused several to
be executed on the evidences raised by
him, and have always remarked that he is
the only profiter by their being put down.
We must move with more caution. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that wench be brought before me, and stop
the execution of Jock's Sandy, whom I
ordered to be hanged to-morrow."</p>

<p>My late benevolent master was watching
the course of these events with punctuality,
and was terribly chagrined when
he heard that his neighbour Jock's Sandy
was reprieved. He was almost beside himself;
but, having great influence with the
holy brethren, he persuaded them to retain
Kell under their jurisdiction, and not give
her up to Lord William. In the course of
his scrutiny he had likewise discovered
some of his gold pieces on her, and had
doomed her to destruction with the rest;
yet, at the same time, he told the holy fathers
to be lenient, and altogether to overlook
that fault, which had originated from
the first, and that was one to which youth
was liable. He conjured them not to give
her up to William the Severe, who would
infallibly doom her to an ignominous death.
If she had deserved that, he said, it was
much better that she should die privately,
in which case he would pay seventy merks
annually to the church for the securing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
her soul. He was frightened for the meeting
of so many criminals before Lord William,
wicked as we were; and so high was
the influence of the convent, of which this
was a branch, that the brethren refused to
give up the offender to Lord William's officers.</p>

<p>After my first examination was over, I
was thrust into a dungeon beside Jock's
Sandy, who had been cast to die for stealing
the ox which I myself slew; and, when
we began to converse freely together, what
a tissue of deceit was unraveled! He asked
me if I knew any thing about that ox
for which he was to lose his life! I said I
knew very well about the ox, for I had killed
him myself: "And what a great fool
you were," said I, "to incur so much danger
for the sake of a nout's hide and a pair
of horns, for these you certainly did steal."</p>

<p>The man was perfectly amazed when I
told him all the truth, and promised to
procure me as much fat flesh as I could
eat every day, if I would tell the truth of
the story to Lord William. I catched at
the offer, for I had suffered so much in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
stomach of late, that I would have done far
more than he required of me for such an advantage.
Indeed I would have done any
thing, or said any thing in the world, that
I might once more enjoy my beloved mess.
He proved as good as his word, for before
night the keeper brought me a whole apron
full of bits and scraps of the fattest meat
that I ever saw,&mdash;beef, mutton, and pork.
There were some square pieces of perfect,
pure white fat, that I sliced down like
cheese! They were from the flanks of fat
beeves, the briskets of wedders, and the
ribs of fatted hogs; and I could not but
admire the want of good taste among the
gentles who had left these savoury bits to
their slaves and prisoners. I was so delighted
that I could not sleep by night, but
always awakened from my straw and fell
a-munching. I wish we saw such a feast
again; but, indeed I saw nothing, for our
house was in utter darkness; but it was a
good meat-house, and I could have been
content to have lived in it all my life.</p>

<p>In a few days I was once more carried
above ground for examination, where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
told the whole truth boldly, but was not
believed. No one would give credit to
the tale, that I had slain one of my master's
fattest oxen for the sake of good cheer;
such a thing, they said, would never come
into a stripling's head, and I had been
suborned to my evidence by my fellow
prisoner. Lord William asked if there
was any proof remaining that I could produce
in support of my assertion? I said I
had a part of the beef remaining, well salted
up in a barrel below ground, and covered
with a moss divot; and that I had likewise
some hid for fresh meat in some cold
well springs, and I would shew them these
if they liked. I was sent with a guard,
and shewed them the remains of my ox;
and when this was reported to Lord William,
he called me a rogue and a glutton,
and caused them to tie a rope about my
neck and lead me through the streets of
the town naked, lashing me with a whip
all the way. He then bade me make off
with myself, for if I was found within
twenty miles of that place where I stood,
he would cause me to be hewed in pieces.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>My late master was taken up, and examined
face to face with those he had accused;
but how he contrived to elude
justice I never knew: ten years after,
one informed me that the dame Kelly had
accused him before Lord William of having
seduced her, and that in the most disgraceful
way, and then of forcing me into
the situation in which I was caught, for a
screen to his own guilt and shame. For
all that, it seems poor Kell was returned
to the convent, and never more heard of,
and sleeky Tam possesses both his own and
his neighbour's farm at this day.</p>

<p>I had begun to think that ill deeds throve
best; but I now conceived that I had paid
very dearly indeed for my late pleasures of
feasting and love, being almost flayed alive.
I cried bitterly as I fled, and cursed Lord
William and his raggamuffians that had
scourged me, and vowed to myself, if I lived
to be a man, that I would be revenged
on them. I likewise cursed my deceitful
master, but I did not curse poor Kell; indeed
I found that it was for her I wept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
most bitterly, thinking myself the cause
of all her shame and suffering.</p>

<p>I fled next into a country called Galloway,
a place which some of you may have
heard of by chance; but I found it the
worst meat country, and the worst country
altogether, that I had ever seen. I lived
there for a number of years, leading a sort
of vagabond life, but quite an honourable
one. I learned naturally among them to
be a great thief, and an acute liar; but I
never stole any thing but fat flesh, nor do
I account any thing else worthy of running
the risk for&mdash;from that no danger
ever could, or ever shall debar me. I care
not much what sort it be, provided it be
juicy, and a layer of white next the bone.
I wonder whether men's flesh is likest to
beef, or mutton, or venison?</p>

<p class="break">"I wish ye wadna always turn your
green een on me that gate when you speak
about your fat flesh," said Gibbie. "I
assure you, mine is neither like beef,
nor mutton, nor venison; and, what is
more, you shall never taste it. I appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
you all, masters and friends, if this man
has not fairly fallen through his tale."</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be very like veal,
then," continued Tam; "and if so, I have
seen a joint of cold veal very excellent
meat, more especially that adjoining the
white gristly part; with a little salt, a man
can eat a great deal of that without being
any thing the worse."</p>

<p>"My masters, I do protest against these
carnivorous looks of the story-teller," rejoined
Gibbie; "they make ane feel so
queerly. It is as if he were tearing my flesh
quick from the banes with his teeth. And
I call you to note that he has sticked a
story, which, from the beginning, is no
story."</p>

<p>"Stay till it be done, an you please,"
said Tam; "the best of my tale is yet to
come; and any man may be allowed a
breathing space and a little refreshment."</p>

<p class="break">At Castle-Fern I fell in with an old man
called the Gorb, an itinerant fencer, who
travelled the country teaching the art of
the sword. To him I attached myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
somewhat against his will; for I saw that,
though he was not everywhere a welcome
guest, he was nevertheless a privileged
one, and always admitted. He was six feet
high, with a beard that hung to his middle,
and his frame was entirely composed of
bones and sinews. The feats that he described
to me of warrior prowess first
raised in me a desire to learn his noble
art; and as soon as I began to manifest a
partiality for his profession, he began to
attach himself to me, but in a manner so
ungracious, that if I had not been a being
quite desperate, I never could have borne
it. We moved on from place to place;
the young men of the country assembled
in parties, as we passed, to attend his lessons;
and at night we had free-quarters
wherever we went; that is, the Gorb was
a free man,&mdash;but many pointed inuendos
were thrown out against my introduction
as an additional burden. These people had
better have let the matter pass over, for he
did not fail to pay them back with interest
in bitter and sarcastic retorts. On
some of these occasions he gave me a ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>rible
character of the country and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"You are come, poor man, to sojourn
in the worst country under the cope of
heaven," said he, "into a place where there
is no faith, no honour, no money, and very
little meat."</p>

<p>"What do they live on in general?"
said I.</p>

<p>"On some wretched roots, pulse, and
black corn," said he; "some lean unhealthy
fish, and still more lean and sapless cattle."</p>

<p>"I like the country a great deal the
worse," said I. "Is the flesh here so very
lean?"</p>

<p>"Why ask?" said he; "have you not
witnessed it?"</p>

<p>"No, I am very sorry I have not," said
I. "I supposed it had been lent in this
country. As for their faith or honour I
care not a pin. Their money is of little
avail to me; but I hate to stay in a country
where there is no meat: and how they
can transact business without money is beyond
my comprehension."</p>

<p>"They have none, however," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
"nor was there ever any in this country.
They transact all their business on a thing
called credit, which commonly attaches itself
to a man for a number of years, sometimes
for a long, and sometimes a very short
term. This enables him to cheat his neighbours
for a time, and all his exertions tend
only to this, namely, how many he can
take in, and to what amount; and when he
has gone as far as this ideal quality of his
can carry him, he takes to the bent, and
leaves them all in the lurch. This is the
exact state of this blessed country called
Galloway, and will be its state as long as
it continues to exist. The only rational
hope concerning it is, that, as it is a sort
of butt-end of the creation, it will perhaps
sink in the ocean, and mankind will be rid
of it."</p>

<p>He then took a hearty fiendish laugh at
the conceit of the country being sunk, and
went on.&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all, I cannot help being amazed
at the rascally crew. Do not you see how
suspicion and distrust are stamped on every
countenance? Every man makes a bargain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
with apparent reluctance, and with a dread
that his neighbour is going to cheat him;
and he is never mistaken. Such is the
country, and such are the people to whom
you have now come, and such must they
ever continue to remain. It is in their nature
to be so, and they cannot be otherwise.
Here am I, their master and benefactor,
who have spent my life in teaching
them the noblest of all sciences, without
which they could not have defended their
country. I have taught every chief in the
country, and every one of their vassals,
and how am I requited? Ill-clothed,
worse fed, and not a bodle in my purse.
All my recompense is the freedom of living
a life of fatigue and wretchedness."</p>

<p>"I will not stay another night in the
country of such a parcel of rogues," said I.</p>

<p>"You are wrong," answered he: "It is
the best country you can be in. You have
nothing to lose, and you may gain much.
Experience is a man's greatest riches; and
of that you will gain abundance. You will
here learn hourly how to oppose cunning
to cunning; and I will teach you the noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
art of opposing masterly skill to brutal
force, until you may haply be established
as my assistant and successor."</p>

<p>"I would rather dispense with the honour,"
said I: "You are too lean for me
to think of being your successor. Were
you a fat full-fed man, I would not say
what I might do to attain the distinction;
but I have made up my mind to one thing,
which is, always to have my meat, honestly
if I can, but at all events to have it."</p>

<p>"You are so far right in your principle,"
said he: "For when we consider of
it, a man can have very little more than
his meat in this world, for all the struggling
and strife there is in it. But since
you set so high a value on good living, I
can, if I please, assist you to it; for, poor
and wretched as I appear, and as I am, I
have a right to call for and command the
best in every house. I could likewise take
their clothes, for money they have none;
but it would be like tearing the hearts out
of the dogs,&mdash;so I content myself with the
meanest fare, rather than humble myself to
ask ought of them."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are an extraordinary man," said
I: "But when I look at you, I cannot
conceive this privilege of yours to exist in
aught but in theory."</p>

<p>"You shall see," said he. "What sort
of meat would you prefer?"</p>

<p>"Fat flesh at all times and all seasons,"
said I: "There is nothing like that.
Whether it be the flesh of bullock, hog, or
wedder, the fattest is always the best."</p>

<p>"What a kite! What a raven! What a
dog!" exclaimed he: "Well, you shall
have it, if it were but to kill you of a surfeit."</p>

<p>We were lying in a barn when this discourse
occurred, and I could not but wonder
what the old fellow would do. It was
customary for us to take our breakfast at
the place where we lodged, and if I might
judge from our supper, the place where we
then were gave no prospect of very rich fare.</p>

<p>The breakfast was produced; a quantity
of black brochen and lentiles. The master
of defence wist not how to break the ice by
introducing a refusal of the proffered meal!
but he considered himself as pledged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
me, and his haughty spirit would not succumb.
His looks were particularly embarrassed
and amusing, and I saw that he
would gladly have been free of his engagement,
as he began a long palaver of general
remarks. I kept up my good hopes,
and gave him always an expecting look
now and then, to make him hold to his
resolution. The people of the house paid
little attention to his harangue, till at
length he concluded with these words:</p>

<p>"Such being the case, and such the state
of the country, I am obliged now to claim
all my rights, privileges, and dues from
every vassal of my lord of Galloway, as
well as from every subject of our liege lord
the king, whose commission I bear. Goodman
Latchie, I accept no more of black
croudy and lentiles for breakfast: I claim,
order, and command the best that is in
this house. In place of that hog's meat,
let us have a rasher on the coals, if you so
please."</p>

<p>"The muckle fiend be atween your
teeth, then, to choak you wi' the first bite!"
said the goodwife.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Farmer Latchie, I contend not with
women," said the man of the sword: "Are
you aware of my rights, or do you know
and dispute them?"</p>

<p>"I consider yours as merely a nominal
right," said he, "which no man is bound
to fulfil, because no man does it. All my
lord's vassals treat you with common fare.
Why should I do more?"</p>

<p>With that a raw-boned young man stepped
forward, with a black beard and a ruffian
look. He was the farmer's eldest son,
and his name was John.</p>

<p>"What is all this din about," said he:
"Let me speak, will ye, Master Gorb?
Either take that which is set before you,
or go away without it. I say that."</p>

<p>"You say that? Do you, sir?" said
my master.</p>

<p>"Yes; sure I do," said he: "I says
that, and I'll say it again too, to be sure I
will."</p>

<p>"Then there is my gage, sir. Do you
know to what you have subjected yourself?"
said my master, pulling out his
sword, and laying it on the board: "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
have given the king's ordained swordsman
the denial; you must fight him, or find
one on the instant to do it for you. If he
kills you, he is entitled to take off your
head and send it to the king; and if you
kill him, you lose your head, and all the
goods and chattels of your house are to be
confiscate. Rescue or no rescue? Draw,
craven! or yield me up the keys of your
pantry, your chest, and your sunken cellar,
you dog."</p>

<p>"I does nae see the sense o' that, Master
Gorb," said John, with a countenance right
sorely altered: "that a man maunna say
his awn's his awn, or what's his father's is
his father's, but that he maun tak up sword
and swordsman. I does nae fear thee. It's
no to say that I fears thee; but I winna be
bullied intil aught; and I just tells thee,
that I'll neither fight thee nor suffer thee
to get a scrap o' aught better than is set
afore thee; and gang and seek thy mends.
Now I says that."</p>

<p>"Thou art a craven and a nincompoop,"
said my master, with the highest indigna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>tion;
"and I lift my pledge, and will report
thee to thy betters."</p>

<p>"Do if thou mayest," cried old Latchie,
running to an armour chest, and taking
from thence a sword and buckler. "Disgrace
of my house! To give the challenge,
and then to flinch. Have with thee,
Bellwether! I will give you to know, that
old masons are the best barrowmen."</p>

<p>"I ground my pledge again, and I take
thee," said my master. But now the old
woman came running between them, crying
out, "Deil be i' your teeth! deil be i'
your teeth! Tak a' that's i' the house an'
haud you wi't: there are the keys; there are
the keys! deil be i' your teeth, take a'&mdash;and
let us alane o' your din." The Gorb waved
the keys aside with his arm in high indignation;
but the wife clung to her point.
"I take you a' witnesses," cried she, "I
take you a' witnesses, I have offered him
the keys, and he has refused them. Here,
young Gorb; young hing-by-the-gut, take
ye them, take ye them. Deil be i' your
teeth, take a' that's i' the house."</p>

<p>I took the keys lest they should be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>got
in the hurry; the two old fellows took
to the field with sword and buckler, while
both the old dame and her son John strove
to interfere; but the old yeoman silenced
them both with a word, and I thought he
would have struck his son down with the
sword, so much was he enraged at his behaviour.</p>

<p>I had seen much sword play by this
time in the way of amusement, or lesson-taking;
but I had never seen two men
meet in deadly foil, and I trembled for the
event; for I judged, that if the old Gorb
was killed, it would fare hardly with me,
being conscious that I was the moving
cause of the combat. My master's demeanour
was altogether inimitable. He went
through every thing as if it had been a
matter of mere ceremony, first slipping
gracefully to one side, crossing his hands on
his breast, bowing profoundly, and then
shaking hands with Latchie: then swimming
gracefully to the other side, and repeating
the same man&oelig;uvre. Last of all,
he wheeled about, cut some wild flourishes
with his sword, and took his distance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
yeoman bit his lip, and appeared to be viewing
all these things with disdain; but he
set himself firm on his legs with his left
foot foremost, and setting up his broad
bonnet before, waited the onset. The Gorb
on the contrary advanced with his right
foot foremost; and, instead of availing himself
of the buckler as the former did, he
came forward bearing it up behind him as
high as his head. He seemed to wear it
merely because the other did, but he was
too proud to make any use of it. Nothing
ever did, or ever will exceed the singularity
of that combat: the figures of the men,
and their manner of fighting, being so different.
Latchie was short and squat, the
Gorb somewhat like the skeleton of a giant.
The art of fighting which the former pursued
was to shield himself behind his broad
buckler, peep over it, and now and then
make dreadful blows around it with the
full swing of his body, as if he meant to cut
my master through the middle, or shear
off both his thighs. On such occasions the
Gorb, beside parrying the stroke, made
such tremendous springs off at a side, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
he rather appeared like a spirit than any
thing of bones, sinews, and blood, for as to
flesh there was none on him; and at every
one of these leaps he uttered a loud "Hoh!"
as if he had been mortally wounded, or in
great danger of having been so; yet all the
while his face was so sublimely grave and
serious as if every movement were to have
been his last. He never attempted to hit
the yeoman, and had apparently no other
aim in fighting, than merely to show his
dexterity in fencing, retreating, and advancing.
I deemed that all was over with him,
and began to be mortally afraid of myself;
and any man would have acknowledged
what good reason I had, if he had witnessed
with what looks the wife and son regarded
me. Every one of them thought
the Gorb had the worst of it, and that the
farmer was sure of the day. Indeed by this
time there was little doubt of it. The old
wife thrice clapped her hands, and screamed
out, "Weel proven, goodman! that
gars him scamper? Weel proven, Daniel
Maclatchie! Lie to the breastleather." At
these words I began to look over my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
shoulder, and meditate a most strenuous
flight. But now the most novel scene of
all occurred: my master still continued to
change his ground, and to skip and fly
about, until at length the yeoman, encouraged
by his wife's words, came hard upon
him, and, heaving up his shield a little, he
came with a deadly stroke round below it,
ettling to cut off both my master's legs.
"Hoh!" cried the Gorb, as loud as he
could vociferate; and as the little squat
yeoman stooped to the stroke, he made
such a spring into the air that he leaped
fairly over his head; and as he passed like
a meteor over above him, he gave him such
a slap with the broad side of his sword on
the hind cants of the head, that it made
the farmer run forward and fall with his
nose on the ground. He was again on his
feet, however, in an instant, and faced
about, while his eyes streamed with water
from the sharpness of the stroke. This feat
astonished the Latchies; but the wife cried
out, "A barley! a barley! foul play!&mdash;he's
fighting on springs."</p>

<p>"Emblem true of thy accursed coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>try!"
cried the Gorb, and kicking off his
sandals at her head, he took his ground on
his bare soles. The combatants set to it
again; but the yeoman was now on his
guard, and fought shy, standing on the defensive.
My master soon grew tired of
this way of fighting; and, after two or
three flying feints at an attack, in a moment
he wrenched Latchie's sword from
his grasp, and threw it into the air like a
sling-stone. The lookers on gazed in
amazement,&mdash;and the astonished yeoman
traced the course of his erratic weapon,
which, after forming an arch like a rainbow,
lighted at the distance of forty yards.
John, the farmer's son, was the first who
ventured a remark on the phenomenon,
which he did with his accustomed shrewdness,
and in the Cumberland brogue, which
he had learned by living some years in that
district.</p>

<p>"Feyther, I thinks thou hast thrown
away thee swoard."</p>

<p>"Ay," said his father, biting his lip, and
looking after it.</p>

<p>By this time the Gorb had his sword at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Latchie's throat, crying, "Rescue, or no
rescue, I say? Yield, traitor, or die."</p>

<p>Latchie paid no regard to him. He only
bit his lip, looked after his sword, and
stood his ground firm without moving,
showing a most unyielding and dauntless
spirit.</p>

<p>The Gorb repeated his threat, but the
yeoman paid no further attention to it than
before.</p>

<p>"What an unlucky accident!" said he.
"Had I not thrown away my sword, I
would have humbled you."</p>

<p>"Do you regret the loss of your sword
so much?" said the Gorb. "Will you promise,
on the honour of a good yeoman,
not to throw it away in like manner
again?"</p>

<p>"Promise?" said the other: "I will
swear on it, and by it, never to part with
it in like manner again."</p>

<p>"Young man," said my master to me,
"run and bring me this brave yeoman's
sword."</p>

<p>I brought it, and he took it by the point,
and delivered it back to the owner with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
all manner of courtesy. Latchie took it
in his hand, and let the point of it slant towards
the ground in token of submission.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, I deliver it," cried my master.
"I would not see such a man show
fear or pusillanimity for any thing. Exchange
me three times three, and no more;
and God stand by the right. I counsel
thee, moreover, to assume thy best defence,
as I propose to do thee all manner
of injury."</p>

<p>"So be it. I defy you still," said Latchie,
and took his ground a second time.
His wife and son spoke a great deal by
way of interference, but were totally disregarded.
The combat began again with
more fury than ever; but at the second or
third time of crossing their weapons, Daniel
Maclatchie's sword betook itself again
into the firmament, and after tracing nearly
the same course as formerly, alighted
on the same spot.</p>

<p>"You are the devil and none else," said
Latchie, "and I yield to my conqueror. I
am at your disposal."</p>

<p>"And I will use my advantage, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
duty and in honour bound," said the Gorb:
"Rise up my friend and brother; you are
a man of true genuine spirit. I honour
you, and I estimate your country more
this morning, for your sake, than I have
hitherto done. I claim your friendship as
a brother in arms. You shall not have
cause to repent this spirited encounter."</p>

<p>The farmer was greatly flattered by this
speech. I gave up the keys; and there
was no end of kindness and endearment
between the two old fellows. We had
our rasher on the coals; and I think I have
scarcely risen from a better diet than I did
that day. I got the greater part to myself,
for the rest were all so busy talking and
drinking cold ale, that they hardly thought
of the bacon. It was nicely toasted, and
the fat stood on it like small drops of
honey. But I must not dwell on the recollection
else I shall faint.</p>

<p>At our meal the yeoman offered my
master a new war cloak, with belts, bands,
and haversack, if he would tell him by
what means he disarmed him with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
ease, and in so extraordinary a manner;
but the other absolutely refused.</p>

<p>"It is allowable in chivalry," said he,
"to learn and practice any mode of manual
defence, and to keep that mode a secret
till you prove it on your opponent. That
is my secret, and by that mode I would
forfeit my life, nay my character itself, to
disarm any man that ever pointed a two-edged
sword at my breast."</p>

<p class="break">"I should have liked very much to have
known that secret of his," said Charlie
Scott.</p>

<p class="break">I found it out privately with the most
perfect certainty, continued Tam; but
durst never let him know that I understood
aught of the matter. It was owing
to his sword's handle, which was made for
the purpose. It had an inner shell of steel
polished like glass; then an outer one of
basket-work, formed with rounded bars in
such a manner that, by turning his hand in
a slight degree to humour the position of
the opponent's sword, and dashing his hilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
against the point of it, that entered between
those of the cross-bars, and, running
up the polished steel within, bent and fixed
itself; then by a sudden wrench against
his opponent's thumb, of which he was a
perfect master, he not only disarmed him
to a certainty, but generally left his arm
powerless. After I had discovered it, I
went by myself to try the experiment,
fixed my own sword, and taking my master's
in my hand, I pushed the basket of
that slightly against the point of the other,
and behold it fixed in it so close, that with
all my might, and all my art, I could not
extricate it without breaking it in two,
and, in that case, I saw I would leave the
point sticking where it was, which I durst
not do for my life. At length it came into
my head to do as my master did. This
had the effect at once; the vibration in the
blade caused by the swing and jerk, made
it loosen, and it flew away through the air
like a fiery dragon.</p>

<p class="break">"Master Michael Scott," said Gibbie,
"and my friends, I again appeal to you all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
if this man has not fallen through his tale.
It is turning out no tale at all, but merely
an offputting of time, till we shall all perish
of hunger."</p>

<p>"The story of the hapless maiden Kell,
and of our hero's first essays in love, I did
admire and prize," said the poet.</p>

<p>"Od help your crazed head," said Charlie:
"I wadna gie that duel atween the
twa auld chaps for a creelfu' o' love stories."</p>

<p>"Lo, the tale is good," said the friar;
"but it goeth here and there, without bound
or limit; and wherefore should not a man
relate all that befalleth unto him. I suppose
it behoveth our friend to go on, without
turning aside to the right hand or to the
left.</p>

<p>"My tale is indeed long, but to me it is
momentous. I should stop here pleasantly;
but life is sweet,&mdash;and, to give me a fair
chance for mine, I beg to be permitted to relate
one adventure more." This, after some
demur, was granted, and Tam went on:</p>

<p class="break">After spending several years among the
hills of Galloway, and being approved of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
by the Gorb (as he was called by every
body, though his name was Macdougald)
for a good swordsman, I tired of the country,
being persuaded that the ground did
not fatten the cattle properly; and from
the moment I began to suspect that, I had
no more satisfaction in the place, but utterly
despised it. I perceived that their beef
was never above an inch thick in the ribs,
and what was worse, it was not properly
mixed with white layers of fat; even the
doubles in the broad bone of the shoulder
were nothing but pure red lire. This will
never do, thought I. How I despise the
people that can put up with such a country
as this!</p>

<p>"Master," says I, one day, "I am quite
tired of this country, and am going to leave
it."</p>

<p>"Wherefore are you going to leave it,
Thomas? Have not I been better and kinder
to you than to myself?"</p>

<p>"For all that, master, I am resolved not
to sojourn another week in it."</p>

<p>"I warned you that they were a deceitful
people before," said he; "but we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
take them as they are. We cannot make
mankind as we would wish to have them."</p>

<p>"It is not for the men, nor for the women
either, that I dislike the country so
much," said I.</p>

<p>"What is it then for?" said he.</p>

<p>"It is," said I, "because I suspect that
their grass is not of a good quality."</p>

<p>I will never forget the look that the
Gorb turned on me. He was walking
somewhat before me, but when he heard
my reason for disliking Galloway he wheeled
about, and, taking one of his most striking
upright positions, with his lean shoulders
set up like two pins, he stared at me
with his mouth wide open; and then put
the following questions to me at long intervals.</p>

<p>"Grass! eh! How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Look at it," said I; "What substance
is in that wiry stuff, and on these hills of
black heather!"</p>

<p>The Gorb's jaws fell down with dismay.
He visibly thought that I was deranged,
but he answered me mildly to humour my
malady.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>"True, the grass is not good; it never
was, and never will be so. But I have not
observed that you ever eat much of it; nor
can I see how a man's happiness any way
depends upon the quality of the grass of a
country."</p>

<p>"If that be all the sense that you have,"
thought I, "I will disdain for my part to
exchange another word with you on the
subject. Since you think that a man's happiness
can depend on <i>any thing else</i> but
good grass, you shall be followed no longer
by me."</p>

<p>"Well," continued he, after waiting a
while for an answer, "I see you are sulky
about this whim, but I will humour it. I
have nearly finished my terms among the
mountains, and we shall descend upon the
shores, where there is as good grass as any
in Scotland, and I promise you full liberty
to go into every field that you chuse, and
take your bellyful of it. I have likewise
many things to teach you, which will amuse
you in the highest degree, and which belong
to the sublime art of legerdemain."</p>

<p>"What is that?" said I.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the art," said he "that enables us
to see things and people as they really are.
There is scarcely any thing on this earth
really what it appears to be; and this art I
have yet to teach you."</p>

<p>From that day forward he began and
performed feats that entirely bewildered
my senses, but which furnished, wherever
we were, a great fund of amusement; all
the young people believed him to be in
compact with the devil. I have forgot
them all but one, which I will remember
as long as I live.</p>

<p>We came to a wealthy yeoman's house
on the river Urr, where we were to remain
several days; and while he exercised the
farmer's sons in fencing, I kept the young
peasants in exercise&mdash;and then in the hall
in the evenings he went on with his cantrips.
There was a delicious shoulder of
bacon hanging up on the farmer's brace,
among many meaner hams and pieces of
wretched dried flesh. I believe I had fixed
my eyes on it, and perhaps my heart a little
too. Whether the Gorb noticed this
and dreaded the consequences or not, I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>not
tell, but he began a speech about things
not being what they appeared to be, and
offered to give us a striking instance."</p>

<p>"Take down the choicest and best ham
among all these above the fire," said he.
I did so, taking down the shoulder of bacon
with great alacrity.</p>

<p>"Take down the worst," said he. I did
so; it was one of venison dried like a crooked
stick.</p>

<p>"Which do you account the best?" said
he. I told him. "Well, you are mistaken,"
said he; "and I'll convince you of
it. Roll them both neatly up in straw,
or as you will."</p>

<p>I did so.</p>

<p>"Now, do you know the one from the
other?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well: heave them up again that
you may not be mistaken in the weight.
Now, cross your hands, and heave them
with different hands. Quite sensible they
are the same?"</p>

<p>"Quite sensible."</p>

<p>"Very well. Take them aside by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>self
and look at them. You will now see
them as they really are, not as they appeared
to your eyes."</p>

<p>I hastened and opened out the shoulder
of bacon. It was nothing but three dried
bones, hanging together by tendons, and
stuffed up into the shape of an overgrown
shoulder of bacon with brawn, which was
covered round with a piece of a sow's hide.
I shed some tears at this blighting discovery;
for though the bacon was not
mine, I felt in my heart that I did not
know how matters were to come about. I
hung the two hams up as they were, and
was cured of my itching eye; but no man
can tell how things will come round to
the advantage of an acute and clever fellow.</p>

<p>While we were at that house, the country
was raised to follow the Lord of Galloway
into Cumberland. It was a great
rising, the utmost quota being demanded
of every yeoman in the country, in terms
of his villanage. Our landlord got a charge
to find five, whereas he had none to send
save three, unless he and his eldest son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
both went, which would have been grievously
against him at that time; so he applied
to my master and me to go on his
behoof, offering large conditions, which
were soon accepted. The principal, if not
the sole thing that induced me to go out
on that raide, was the stipulation that I was
to have my choice of all the meat in the
house, to the amount of what I could conveniently
carry on my back in a march.
After a great deal of choosing, I fixed on
a small beef-ham, because it was solid, and
no bones in it, and blest my master's ingenuity
that had let me into the secret of
the deceitful shoulder of bacon. The next
that came after me was a blade of endless
frolic and humour, named Harestanes.
He instantly snapped at the bacon-ham,
and popped it into his goatskin wallet,
nodding his head, and twisting his mouth
at me, as much as if he had said, "What a
taste you have! I am glad you had not
the sense to take this." I could easily
have prevented him, by revealing the secret;
but he had always been trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
make a fool of me, therefore I could
scarcely contain my mirth at his mistake,
and resolved to enjoy his disappointment
in full. He was a sprightly handsome
youth, and had such a forward and impertinent
manner that he contrived to make
friends in every family that we passed by,
particularly with the women, so that he
lacked nothing that he desired; and tho'
I watched him night and day for fear of
losing the sport, he never took out his bacon
to break it up till the fourth day after
our departure. My beef-ham was by that
time more than half done. It was a most
wretched piece of meat, being as hard as
wood, and bitter as gall; but I was still
comforted with this, that it was so much
better than my comrade's.</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock on a morning,
on the English side of the Border,
that Harestanes first loosed out his wallet
to make a breakfast of his bacon; and he
being very hungry, I sat down beside
him to enjoy the sport, taking out my
black beef likewise. All that I could do I
could not retain my gravity while he was
loosening the cords, and taking the straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
from about his ham, which made him look
wistfully at me, and ask what the fool
meant? But when I saw him look seriously
and greedily at it, and then take out his
knife to cut off a great slice, I lost all power,
and fell on the ground in a convulsion
of laughter, while my voice went away to
a perfect wheezle. He could not comprehend
me in the least degree, and actually
began to cut! yes, he actually began to
cut through the bristly skin, while I lay
spurring the ground, and screaming with
anticipation of the grand joke that was to
ensue. Before I could recover my sight
from amid the tears of extravagant mirth,
the scene was changed; and I shall never
forget the position in which the puppy sat,
when my eyes cleared. No, it is impossible
I ever can forget it! Conceive a wicked
impertinent frolicksome whelp of a tailor,
for he was nothing better, who had been
with Sir Robert Graham's maids all the
night, and was so hungry that you might
almost have cast a knot on him, sit down
to take a hearty luncheon of his bacon
ham; and then conceive his looks when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
found he had nothing but rubbish and dry
bones. If you conceive these, you will conceive
the very scene that I saw, at least that
I conceived and saw in my mind's eye.
How could I but laugh? No! It was impossible
I could abstain from laughter;&mdash;but
yet, for all that, things turned out quite the
reverse. He had actually sliced off a rasher
of bacon, the fattest, the whitest, and the
most beautiful rasher of bacon ever I had
seen in my life! There were three distinct
layers of lire and fat, curving alternately
through it like quarter moons. No man
ever beheld such a sight! He sliced out
another piece, which was still more perfectly
beautiful than the preceding one. My
eyes darkened. I had seen enough to
shew me the enormity of my folly, and my
irreparable loss! He roasted his rashers on
the fire. The fat fried out of them, and
flamed among the embers; and when he
laid them on his bread, they soaked it all
with pure liquid fat. And there was I sitting
beside him, gnawing at my piece of
infernal beef, the sinewy hip of some hateful
Galloway stott that had died of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
blackleg, and, having been unfit for ought
else, had been dried till the hateful substance
was out of it. Yet I had my choice
of both, and took this. I shall never wish
any friend of mine to suffer such pangs as
I did that morning; for all that I had suffered
in my dangers and disappointments
was nothing to them. I would fain have
slain the Gorb privately; but not daring to
do that, I resolved never to see his face
again, after the vile trick he had played.
All my hopes and all my enjoyments of
the foray being now ended, I resolved on
taking my departure, and that by the time
my enemy had the first slice of bacon eaten.</p>

<p>We had orders to halt all that day, for
the Johnstons and the Jardines were a
day's march before us. Their advanced columns
had fallen back; and as the troops
were sleeping or straggling about, I prepared
for my departure. My comrade having
been with the knight's women all the
night, a set of creatures madder than himself,
he was quite worn out; and as soon as
he got his inside lined with the salutary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
beverage, he fell fast asleep. An inward
light now began to dawn on my heart,
brighter than the sun at noon day, and
lighting my steps forward to future felicity.
My breath cut short with ecstatic delight,
and my knees trembled as I formed the resolution
of changing hams with my hopeful
comrade. His wallet was lying open&mdash;not so
the tailor's eyes: I might have exchanged
coats, and shoes too, for him. The great
work was done in an instant. I whipped
out his shoulder of bacon, and put my
piece of black timber in its place. "Take
you that, honest man," said I to myself:
"Time about is fair play. I have given
you something that will exercise your
jaws for a while."</p>

<p>When I found that I had this most delicious
of all morsels on my back, I was so
light that I scarcely felt my feet touch the
ground; and there being no time now to
lose, I made straight away into England,
for I durst not turn towards Scotland, the
sentinels being so very thick on that quarter.
Our advanced guard was composed of the
Gordons from the Ken,&mdash;a set of desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
raggamuffins whom I durst not have gone
among had it not been fair forenoon. I had
my wallet on my back and my sword by
my side; and when I saw any of them
eying me, I went up to them and asked
how far the Johnstons were before us?</p>

<p>"What the devil was I wanting with
the Johnstons?"</p>

<p>"O, I was afraid there might be a battle
fought before I saw it, which I would
not should happen for any thing in the
world."</p>

<p>"Hear to the coulter-nibbit piper," said
one.</p>

<p>"He is as like supping a pint o' fat
brose as killing an Englishman," said another.</p>

<p>"I wadna trust him wi' ought beyond
a litter o' English pigs," said a third.</p>

<p>"Let him gang forrit, and fiend that he
get his chafts clawn the first sword that's
drawn! I wadna that his name were Gordon
for a hunder civis."</p>

<p>Accordingly I got liberty to pass; but
as soon as I got out of sight, I turned to
the left, and escaped to the moors of Bew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>castle.
I had now found out the invaluable
art of flint and frizzle, and could
kindle a fire whenever I pleased. So I
sought out a lonely wild dell, and lighting
a fire of birns and strong heather, roasted
two slashing slices of my shoulder of bacon.
I also took a good shave of bread
from my friend the tailor's hearth-bannock;
but after all I could not think of adulterating
the savoury delicious fare by any unnatural
intermixture,&mdash;so I ate up the dry
bread by itself, and then smacked up the
bacon afterwards. I cannot describe my
sensations of delight, not only in my meal,
but in contemplating the beauty of the
object. I sat long feasting my eyes on the
beauty of the slices before I committed
them to the coals. They were curved so
beautifully in semi-circles, the fat and the
lire time about, that, unless for such an
object, the term <i>beauty</i> would have no
meaning. They lay alternately, as if it
were this way, and this way, and this way.</p>

<p class="break">"I protest against your drawing of your
pictures on my shoulder," cried Gibbie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
"and also against the party being any
longer mocked with such fulsome trash in
place of a story. Do you not perceive,
Sir Master, and do you not all perceive,
that he is havering and speaking without
end or aim? He is sensible that he has
failed in his story; and that a dismal fate
awaits him, and all that he is now intent
on is driving of time."</p>

<p>"I confess that I am sick of the bacon
and other fat things," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"My soul disdains the abject theme,"
said the poet: "Its tantalizing sight is like
the marshfire's vacant gleam to the bewildered
wight. 'Tis throwing meat to
hungry souls, with fainting sore opprest;
or drink unto the parched lips, whereof they
may not taste."</p>

<p>"Let us show some spirit, wretched as
we are," said Gibbie, "and protest with
one assent against being farther sickened,
as well as mocked by such loathsome stuff."</p>

<p>This is unfair, and using undue influence,"
cried Tam. "None of you were
thus interrupted, but got time to finish
your stories as you liked. Mine is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
done; the best part of it is yet to come,
and I say it is unfair. Great Master, you
sit as judge; I appeal to you. My life has
been varied. Let them chuse what sort of
a theme they want, and I will fit them,
only suffer me to relate one other exploit."</p>

<p>The Master, on whom hunger seemed
to make no impression, thought the request
was reasonable; but in making choice,
every one of them, young and old, pitched
on a different subject, so that Tam could
not get proceeded; neither can this chapter,
as an extraordinary incident befel,
which naturally brings it to an end.</p>

material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
